Hence it will weaken incentives and can therefore be counterproductive.  This phenomenon is explored in a framework where improving the quality of information makes a commitment not to renegotiate less credible.  Applications to the theory of the firm are briefly explored.

AB I investigate the factors that fostered rising retirement rates prior to social security and most private-sector pensions by estimating the income effect of the first major pension program in the United Sates, that covering Union Army veterans.  The elasticity of nonparticipation with respect to Union Army pension income was 0.73.  The findings suggest that secularly rising income explains a substantial part of increased retirement rates.  Comparisons with elasticities of nonparticipation with respect to social security income suggest that the elasticity of labor force nonparticipation may have decreased with time, perhaps because of the increasing attractiveness of leisure.

AB We examine daily prices of eight goods at seventeen retail stores collected in Ann Arbor, Michigan, over a four-month period from November 1 to February 28.  We focus on weekly and seasonal price patterns, and on the frequency of price markdowns or ''sales.''  There were frequent markdowns in the intensive shopping period prior to Christmas, and a tendency for such sales to occur on weekends.  We interpret these findings as evidence that a significant number of markdowns are timed to occur when shopping intensity is exogeneously high.  We complement the imperfect information-based motives for sales in the literature by contributing an additional element based on the role of bulk shopping and increasing returns in the shopping technology.

Our study covers four types of indicators:  urban air pollution, the state of the oxygen regime in river basins, fecal contamination of river basins, and contamination of river basins by heavy metals.  We find no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth.  Rather, for most indicators, economic growth brings an initial phase of deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement.  The turning points for the different pollutants vary, but in most cases they come before a country reaches a per capita income of $8000.

Creditors are more likely to finance credit-constrained firms when credit markets are concentrated because it is easier for these creditors to internalize the benefits of assisting the firms.  The paper offers evidence from small business data in support of this hypothesis.

Recognizing the important effects of IRA plans on corporate tax revenue changes previous conclusions about the revenue loss in a fundamental way.  The revenue loss associated with IRAs either is much smaller than has generally been estimated or is actually a revenue gain.

ID TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH
AB According to endogenous growth theory, permanent changes in certain policy variables have permanent effects on the rate of economic growth.  Empirically, however, U.S. growth rates exhibit no large persistent changes.  Therefore, the determinants of long-run growth highlighted by a specific growth model must similarly exhibit no large persistent changes, or the persistent movement in these variables must be offsetting.  Otherwise, the growth model is inconsistent with time series evidence.  This paper argues that many AK-style models and R&D-based models of endogenous growth are rejected by this criterion.  The rejection of the R&D-based models is particularly strong.

TI THE WAGE DISTRIBUTION IN A MODEL OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF SKILLS TO JOBS
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-SELECTION; EARNINGS; LABOR; PRICES; MARKET
AB This paper discusses a general equilibrium model of the assignment of heterogeneous workers to heterogeneous jobs.  Both jobs and workers are measured along a continuous one-dimensional scale.  The composition of labor supply is represented by a distribution function.  Workers maximize their earnings.  Highly skilled workers have an absolute advantage in all jobs and a comparative advantage in complex jobs.  Utility is represented by a constant elasticity of substitution function defined over the output of an infinite number of jobs.  Equilibrium is characterized by a mapping of skills on complexities.  The model is able simultaneously to explain the remuneration of skill, the allocation of skills to jobs, and variations in labor demand per job type.  Estimation results for the Netherlands for 1982 and 1988 offer support for its relevance.  Wage differentials are due mainly to skill differentials in the left tail of the distribution and to differences between jobs in the right tail.

ID MARGINAL-COST; INDUSTRY; SHOCKS; PRICE
AB It is well known that under the assumptions of constant returns to scale, perfect competition, and the absence of factor hoarding, primal and dual productivity measures should be highly correlated.  The apparent lack of correlation is usually attributed to fixed factors of production.  In this paper I propose an alternative explanation by relaxing the assumption of perfect competition.  By controlling for the presence of a markup component, I demonstrate that both productivity measures are in fact highly correlated for U.S. manufacturing.  The analysis also provides an alternative method of estimating a markup of prices over marginal cost that avoids certain difficulties inherent in some existing methods of estimation.

AB We examine the principal journals of economics, with particular attention to the communication between journals, as reflected by the network of interjournal citations during 1987-90, and the changes over the past century in the characteristics of the authors and the techniques they have used.  The numerical results, and those of the statistical modeling of these results, reinforce the importance of economic theory as an exporter of intellectual influence to applied economics.  The study includes an examination of the degree of specialization among different subfields of economics.  A statistical model is presented for measuring the flow of intellectual influence (as measured by citations) in terms of simple univariate scores.

AB Micro data studies of household saving often find a significant group in the population with virtually no wealth, raising concerns about heterogeneity in motives for saving.  In particular, this heterogeneity has been interpreted as evidence against the life cycle model of saving.  This paper argues that a life cycle model can replicate observed patterns in household wealth accumulation after accounting explicitly for precautionary saving and asset-based, means-tested social insurance.  We demonstrate theoretically that social insurance programs with means tests based on assets discourage saving by households with low expected lifetime income.  In addition, we evaluate the model using a dynamic programming model with four state variables.  Assuming common preference parameters across lifetime income groups, we are able to replicate the empirical pattern that low-income households are more likely than high-income households to hold virtually no wealth.  Low wealth accumulation can be explained as a utility-maximizing response to asset-based, means-tested welfare programs.

AB Borrowing on credit cards at high interest rates might appear irrational.  However, even low transactions costs can make credit cards attractive relative to bank loans.  Credit cards also provide liquidity services by allowing consumers to avoid some of the opportunity costs of holding money.  The effect of alternative interest rates on the demand for card debits can explain why credit card interest rates only partially reflect changes in the cost of funds.  Credit card interest rates that are inflexible relative to the cost of funds are not inconsistent with a competitive equilibrium that yields zero profits for the marginal entrant.

AB Despite Familiar arguments for diversification, many investors choose to hold significant blocks of equity in the same firm. While control benefits may explain majority blocks, most blocks are much smaller than what is generally considered necessary for control. This paper develops a theory whereby such blocks can confer to their holders partial benefits of control; in particular, small block shareholders can join together and form controlling coalitions. The implications of such a cooperative game among block shareholders for the shareholder structure within and across firms are examined. This paper predicts large investors will ''create their own space'' by staking out large enough blocks to deter other block investors, there will be a threshold level above which large investors are not challenged, and that the shareholder structure across firms will exhibit a particular clientele effect among Mock shareholders. These predictions are consistent with a preliminary review of empirical evidence.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of a basic income maintenance problem for a group of individuals who differ in their income generating abilities. It stresses the impact that imperfect information about such abilities has on programme design. The analysis serves two purposes. First, we are able to unify the theoretical literature on the income maintenance problem. Second, we examine the impact of allowing the government to impose workfare on recipients of income support. In addition to being of policy interest, this is a theoretically challenging problem since it requires solving a multi-dimensional screening problem. The solution that we find is strikingly simple. It separates the poor into two categories, with the lower income groups subject to workfare while facing a 100% marginal tax rate on earnings. The second group does no public work and is offered a benefit schedule which taxes earnings at a lower rate.

ID ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION
AB In the competitive model, externalities lead to inefficiencies, and inefficiencies increase with the size of externalities. However, as argued by Cease, these problems may be mitigated in a decentralized system through voluntary coordination. We show how coordination is limited by the combination of two factors: respect for individual autonomy and the existence of private information. Together they imply that efficient outcomes can only be achieved through coordination when external effects are relatively large. Moreover, there are instances in which coordination cannot yield any improvement at all, despite common knowledge that social gains from agreement exist. This occurs when external effects are relatively small, and this may help to explain why coordination is so seldom observed in practice. When improvements are possible, we describe how simple subsidies can be used to implement second-best solutions and explain why standard solutions, such as Pigovian taxes, cannot be used. Possible extensions to issues arising in the structure of research joint ventures, assumptions in the endogenous growth literature, and the location of environmental hazards are also described.

ID INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; EQUILIBRIUM; GOVERNMENT; REFORM; GROWTH
AB Standard models of public education provision predict an implicit transfer of resources from higher-income individuals toward lower-income individuals. Many studies have documented that public higher education involves a transfer in the reverse direction. We show that this pattern of redistribution is an equilibrium outcome in a model in which education is only partially publicly provided and individuals vote over the extent to which it is subsidized. We characterize economies in which poorer individuals are effectively excluded from obtaining an education and their tax payments help offset the cost of education obtained by others. We show that increased inequality in the income distribution makes this outcome more likely and that the efficiency implications of this exclusion depend on the wealth of the economy.

TI DURATION TO FIRST JOB AND THE RETURN TO SCHOOLING - ESTIMATES FROM A

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB This paper investigates the properties of the joint distribution of the duration to the first post-schooling full-time job and of the accepted wage for that job within a search-matching-bargaining theoretic model. The model provides an interpretation of the observations on duration to first job and accepted wages that differentiates between behavioural influences and market fundamentals in determining the accepted wage-schooling relationship. The return to schooling is appropriately measured by differences in the wage offer distribution, which depends only on market fundamentals. We use data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience to follow several school-leaving cohorts of young males. A model which allows for five types of heterogeneous workers within schooling/race groups fits the duration and wage data well for all such groups. Offer probabilities for all groups are estimated to be close to one. Mean offered wages are about $1000 less than mean accepted wages and the internal annual rate of return for attending college relative to graduating from high school is 32% for blacks and 17% for whites.

ID PORTFOLIO RULES; HABIT FORMATION; OPTION
AB Duesenberry's ratcheting consumption demand is derived as a feature of the optimal dynamic consumption and investment policy given extreme habit formation that prevents consumption from falling over time. Preferences are in effect non-time-separable extended-real-valued von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences. Consumption increases each time wealth reaches a new maximum. Risky investment is proportional to the excess of wealth over the perpetuity value of current consumption. Extensions constrain the net rate of decrease in consumption with a constant other than zero, add more consumption goods, and constrain on the maximal holding of the risky asset as a proportion of wealth. These strategies may be useful for the management of university endowments, participatory investment accounts, and risky arbitrage funds.

AB Within a hierarchical firm structure, this paper details how the composition of a worker's skills and the non-observability of a worker's ability affect wage and promotion paths. Promotion-based compensation schemes derive naturally from the worker's asymmetrically observed ability. Promotion takes place over time and is inefficient since employers strategically exploit their knowledge of an able worker's ability. Conversely, employers may be unable to efficiently demote and retain bad managers without paying bonuses. Employers are led to promote educated employees before their equally or more able, but uneducated, counterparts. Explanations for fast-track promotions plans, and other empirical regularities are provided.

Voters are assumed to make comparisons between jurisdictions to overcome political agency problems. This forces incumbents into a (yardstick) competition in which they care about what other incumbents are doing. We provide a theoretical framework and empirical evidence using U.S. stare data from 1960 to 1988. The results are encouraging to the view that vote-seeking and tar-setting are tied together through the nexus of yardstick competition.

Unlike their illegal counterparts, legal cartels have published regulations and broader enforcement capabilities. However differences in costs and size among cartel members still make quota selection contentious. Conflicts over quotas are typically resolved by voting. Side-payments to influence votes are prohibited. We examine the predicted effects of this real-would voting institution on prices and welfare, We also deduce the economic consequences of exogenous political changes such as alterations in the voting weights or in the identity of the voters.

AB The neoclassical growth model accords with empirical evidence on convergence if capital is viewed broadly to include human investments, so that diminishing returns to capital set in slowly, and if differences in government policies or other variables create substantial differences in steady-state positions. However, open-economy versions of the theory predict higher rates of convergence than those observed empirically. We show that the open-economy model conforms with the evidence if an economy can borrow to finance only a portion of its capital, for example, if human capital must be financed by domestic savings.

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; GROWTH
AB Long-term economic development involves four fundamental processes: the exploitation of increasing returns to specialization, the transition from household to market production, knowledge and human-capital accumulation, and industrialization. This paper integrates these processes into a coherent framework for thinking about economic history. Pre-industrial development is driven by increasing returns to specialization made possible by a growing population. Increasing specialization eventually activates a learning technology and initiates industrial growth, which carries the economy to a fully market-based balanced-growth path. Among other things, we attribute a role to population and market size that is consistent with the evidence.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE; EXCHANGE; UTILITY
AB How did it become possible to exchange apparently valueless pieces of paper for goods? This paper provides an equilibrium account of the transition between barter and fiat-money regimes. The explanation relies on the intervention of a self-interested government which must be able to promise credibly to limit the issue of money. To achieve credibility, the government must offset the benefits of seigniorage by internalizing some of the macroeconomic externalities generated by the issue of fiat money. The government's patience and the extent of its involvement in the economy are key determinants of whether the transition can be accomplished.

ID MONETARY-POLICY; PRIVATE INFORMATION; RULES
AB This paper adopts a principal-agent framework to determine how a central banket's incentives should be structured to induce the socially optimal policy. Im contrast to previous findings using ad hoc targeting rules, the inflation bias of discretionary policy is eliminated and an optimal response to shocks is achieved by the optimal incentive contract, even in the presence of private central-bank information. In the one-period model that has formed the basis for much of the literature on discretionary monetary policy, it is shown that the optimal contract ties the rewards of the central banker to realized inflation.

AB Trade on international financial markets allows people to insure country-specific risk and smooth consumption intertemporally. Equilibrium models of business cycles with trade on global financial markets typically yield international consumption correlations near 1 and excessive volatility of investment. We incorporate ate nontraded goon's in the model and find that the implications for aggregate consumption, investment, and the trade balance are consistent with business-cycle properties of industrialized countries. However, the model driven by technology shocks alone yields counterfactual implications for comovements between consumption and prices at the sectoral level. Taste shocks produce price - quantity relationships more consistent with the data.

ID LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS; PANEL DATA; CONSUMPTION
AB This paper isolates households in the PSID whose heads can be matched to particular long-term union contracts with high confidence. I use published information on these contracts to construct a household-specific measure of expected wage growth. I find that predictable wage movements are significantly correlated with consumption changes, contrary to neoclassical consumption theory. I find that consumption responds more strongly to predictable income declines than to predictable income increases. This asymmetry is inconsistent with liquidity constraints and myopia but is qualitatively consistent with models in which preferences exhibit loss aversion.

AB Regressions of multiple-period changes in the log exchange rate on the deviation of the log exchange rate from its ''fundamental value,'' display evidence that long-horizon changes in log nominal exchange rates contain an economically significant predictable component. To account for small-sample bins and size distortion in asymptotic tests, inference is drawn from bootstrap distributions generated under the null hypothesis that the log exchange rate is unpredictable. The bias-adjusted slope coefficients and R(2)'s increase with the forecast horizon, and the out-of-sample point predictions generally outperform the driftless random walk at the longer horizons.

The model matches important features of postwar data well and provides a structural explanation of the correlation between real output and the short-term nominal rate of interest. We perform a battery of monetary-policy experiments which show that, as viewed through the lens of this model, monetary policy has struck a good balance recently among competing monetary-policy objectives.

AB This paper uses the television game show ''Jeopardy!'' as a natural experiment to analyte behavior under uncertainty and the ability of players to choose strategic best-responses. The results suggest that, while most players bet in a rational manner the failure rate for choosing best-responses increases as the betting problem grows more complex and that players' choices are affected by the ''frame'' of the problem. However, suboptimal betting tends to decrease as inferior players are driven from the game. The data also allow for estimation of the extent of risk aversion; the results imply near risk-neutrality.

DE EXTENDED MEMORY; NONLINEAR; INTEGRATED PROCESSES; BALANCED EQUATIONS
AB Many economic variables have a persistence property which may be called extended memory and the relationship between variables may well be nonlinear. This pair of properties allow for many more types of model misspecification than encountered with stationary or short-memory variables and linear relationships, and misspecifications lead to greater modelling difficulties. Examples are given using the idea of a model being balanced.
   Alternative definitions of extended memory are considered and a definition based on the properties of optimum forecasts is selected for later use. An important but not necessarily pervasive class of processes are those that are extended-memory but whose changes are short-memory. For this case, called I(1), standard cointegration ideas will apply.
   Tests of linearity are discussed in both the I(1) case, where a possible group of tests is easily found, and more generally. Similarly, methods of building nonlinear models based on familiar techniques, such as neural networks and projection pursuit, are briefly considered for I(1) and the more general case. A number of areas requiring further work in this new area are emphasized.

AB Robust estimation aims at developing point estimators that are not highly sensitive to errors in the data. However, the population parameters of interest are not identified under the assumptions of robust estimation, so the rationale for point estimation is not apparent. This paper shows that under error models used in robust estimation, unidentified population parameters can often be bounded. The bounds provide information that is not available in robust estimation. For example, it is possible to obtain finite bounds on the population mean under contaminated sampling. A method for estimating the bounds is given and illustrated with an application. It is argued that when the data may be contaminated or corrupted, estimating the bounds is more natural than attempting point estimation of unidentified parameters.

AB A statistical model of dynamic intrafamily investment behavior incorporating endowment heterogeneity is estimated to evaluate alternative estimation procedures that have exploited family and kinship data. These procedures, which place alternative restrictions on the endowment structure and on behavior, include generalized least squares, instrumental-variables, fixed-effects based on the children of sisters, fixed-effects based on siblings, and sibling fixed-effects with instrumental variables. The framework is applied to data on birth outcomes, with focus on the effects of teen-age childbearing net of other maternal behavior. The empirical results imply that the least restrictive statistical formulation, consistent with dynamic behavior and heterogeneity among siblings, fits the data best. All of the estimation procedures that control for a family-specific endowment indicate, however, that the biological effect of having a birth at younger ages is to marginally increase birthweight and to increase fetal growth.

The model includes stochastic queues, time-varying traffic rates, and endogenous, intertemporal adjustment of traffic in response to queuing delay and fees. Relative costs of queuing and schedule delays are estimated using data from Minneapolis-St. Paul. Simulations calculate equilibrium traffic patterns, queuing delays, schedule delays, congestion fees, airport revenues, airport capacity, and efficiency gains. The paper also investigates whether a dominant airline internalizes delays its aircraft impose. It tests game-theoretic specifications with atomistic, Nash-dominant, Stackelberg-dominant, and collusive-airline traffic.

AB We consider a k-player sequential bargaining model in which the size of the cake and the order in which players move follow a general Markov process. For games in which one agent makes an offer in each period and agreement must be unanimous, we characterize the sets of subgame perfect and stationary subgame perfect payoffs. With these characterizations, we investigate the uniqueness and efficiency of the equilibrium outcomes, the conditions under which agreement is delayed, and the advantage to proposing. Our analysis generalizes many existing results for games of sequential bargaining which build on the work of Stahl (1972), Rubinstein (1982), and Binmore (1987).

AB Core allocations may be defined for infinite horizon capital accumulation models. If agents cannot trust each other in the sense of Gale, then agents may renege on their commitments; their decisions appear time inconsistent. A core allocation is a recursive core allocation provided no coalition can improve upon its consumption stream at any time given its accumulation of assets up to that period. We show for every allocation of consumption in the initial core, one can find a distribution of capital stocks among the agents where no coalition of agents will break the initial core contract at any date. It follows that if the proper distribution of the streams of capital is achieved, then the allocation in the core is also in the recursive core. The latter therefore forges a link between the distribution of wealth (capital), the problem of trust, and time consistent intertemporal contracts.

ID TIME-SERIES; BUSINESS CYCLES
AB Nonlinear endogenous theories of the business cycle have been rarely subject to statistical estimation and testing.  This paper is an attempt to overcome the difficulties in deriving a univariate reduced form from the disequilibrium inventory model of Laroque (1989).  This reduced form is fitted to the quarterly U.S. GNP series over the after war period using full information maximum likelihood.  The results are encouraging:  the model reproduces the pattern of the observed cycles.  But the data seem not to be informative enough to statistically discriminate between the present reduced form and a linear specification.

AB Some examples of the regression method are compared with likelihood based inference.  It is shown that although the asymptotic theory is distinctly different for ergodic and non-ergodic processes, the likelihood methods lead to the result that asymptotic inference can be conducted in the same way for the two cases by appealing to classical conditioning arguments from statistics using the notion of S-ancillarity or strong exogeneity.  It is pointed out that the Fisher information can be considered a measure of the conditional variance of the maximum likelihood estimator given the available information in the sample.

The effect of income while unemployed is found to be much weaker for the 1987 cohort, an elasticity of -0.1 compared with -0.4, and is only found to be significant for teenagers and in the first three months of a spell.  Demand constraints, measured by the local unemployment rate, are found to have a stronger negative effect on the exit probability for the 1987 cohort than in 1978.

ID MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD METHODS; PANEL DATA; FIRMS; UK
AB This paper examines the application of count data models to firm level panel data on technological innovations.  The model we propose exhibits dynamic feedback and unobserved heterogeneity.  We develop a fixed effects estimator that generalises the standard Poisson and negative binomial models allowing for dynamic feedback through both the firm's stock of knowledge and its product market power.  By using the long pre-sample history of innovation information this ''entry stock'' estimator is shown to control for correlated fixed effects and is compared with an alternative nonlinear GMM estimator.  We find evidence of history dependence in innovation activity although variables reflecting the company's economic environment are also found to play a major role.

AB One component of research assessment has been, and will continue to be, the explicit (or implicit) ranking of journals.  Despite the obvious limitations, citations data are generally used to generate rankings as they provide one of the few quantifiable aspects of a journal's performance.  Previous ranking schemes based on multiple performance measures constructed from citations data, such as the 'Diamond Core', can be criticised for their use of 'arbitrary' weighting schemes to generate their final rankings.  This paper addresses this problem by applying ranking techniques, namely, Data Envelopment Analysis and Integer Programming, which systematically allow for multiple performance measures.

AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate numerically the semi-American callable bond by means of finite difference methods.  This study implies three results.  First, the numerical error is greater for the callable bond price than for the straight bond price, and too large for real applications.  Secondly, the numerical accuracy of the callable bond price computed for the relevant range of interest rates depends entirely on the finite difference scheme which is chosen for the boundary points.  Thirdly, the boundary scheme which yields the smallest numerical error with respect to the straight bond does not perform best with respect to the callable bond.

Published forecasts based on large-scale models are rarely purely model-based, but often include extensive adjustments.  Forecasters' adjustments tend to improve forecast accuracy, but there is no evidence of their impact on the rationality of forecasts.  Using series of revisions to forecasts we find little evidence that published forecasts are excessively smooth in the Nordhaus (1987) sense, but intercept corrections do appear to reduce the variation over time in purely model-based forecasts and to alter the underlying output/inflation trade-off implicit in the model.

AB Mainstream interpretations of Keynes's General Theory are surveyed.  An alternative post-classical interpretation is proposed.  Keynes is interpreted as treating classical theory as the valid theory of allocation but this type of theory is of limited relevance for macro analysis.  The productive sector is characterised by the utilisation mode of activity regulated by the non-allocative multiplier process.  However the financial sector is allocative and Keynes proposed the allocative theory of liquidity preference.  It is argued that this dual conception of the macro economy is suggestive of the need for a more realistic method in macroeconomics.

AB This paper examines the implications of extending the Ahmad-Stern model of indirect tax reform to include labour supply.  The inclusion of labour supply alters the basic measure of marginal revenue cost (MRC) of indirect taxation and introduces the possibility of calculating a MRC for direct taxation.  The paper derives the expressions for these revised MRCs and provides estimates from Irish data.  It then examines the sensitivity of the results to assumptions regarding functional form and, in particular, goods/leisure separability.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

AB The paper analyses problems of implementing non-economic conditionality, such as military expenditure reduction, in the granting of foreign aid given the presence of asymmetric information.  We present two conceptually separate principal-agent models, to capture the stylised facts of multilateral and bilateral aid negotiations respectively.  The first model is an application of the problem of adverse selection when there is more than one type of principal (donor) with varying objectives.  The second model extends moral hazard to double moral hazard, where neither principal nor agent (recipient) can fully observe or verify each other's strategies.

AB This paper considers a number of policy measures that may be used to preserve a fixed exchange rate.  These are analysed in a model where a switch of exchange rate regime is triggered by an optimising policy-maker in response to extreme economic conditions.  It is shown how a number of policy measures can be used to alter the balance between the costs and benefits of switching between regimes.  These policy measures have both a direct effect on the policy-maker's choice of regime switching point and an indirect effect through private-sector expectations of a regime switch.

Common components of uncertainty lead to market inferences of managerial ability based on relative performance.  Managers who undertake the industry standard are consequently evaluated with a more accurate benchmark than those innovating.  Discontinuities in compensation when performance is low (because of firings) lead managers to have differing valuations of an accurate benchmark, depending on type.  In particular, very high and very low ability managers are more likely to undertake superior innovations than those of average ability.

AB Anarchy, defined as a system in which participants can seize and defend resources without regulation from above, is not chaos but rather a spontaneous order. However, anarchy is fragile and may dissolve either into formless ''amorphy'' or into a more organized system such as hierarchy. Under anarchy, each contestant balances between productive exploitation of the current resource base and fighting to acquire or defend resources. Anarchy is sustainable only when there are strongly diminishing returns to fighting effort (the ''decisiveness parameter'' is sufficiently low) and incomes exceed the viability minimum. These considerations explain many features of animal and human conflict.

AB ''Income smoothing'' is the process of manipulating the time profile of earnings or earnings reports to make the reported income stream less variable.  This paper builds a theory of income smoothing based on the managers' concern about keeping their position or avoiding interference, and on the idea that current performance receives more weight than past performance when one is assessing the future.  When investment is added to the model, so that income reports and dividends can be set independently, we find that both dividends and income reports may be smoothed and that dividends may convey information not present in the income report.

AB A fundamental equilibrium condition underlying most utility-based asset pricing models is the equilibration of intertemporal marginal rates of substitution (IMRS).  Previous empirical research, however, has found that the comovements of consumption and asset return data fail to satisfy the restrictions imposed by this equilibrium condition.  In this paper, we examine whether market frictions can explain previous findings.  Our results suggest that a combination of short-sale, borrowing, solvency, and trading cost frictions can drive a large enough wedge between IMRS so that the apparent violations may not be inconsistent with market equilibrium.

AB The goal of this paper is to extend existing search-theoretic models of fiat money, which until now have assumed that the price level is exogenous, by explicitly incorporating bilateral bargaining.  This allows us to determine the price level endogenously and leads to additional insights concerning the role of money.  For example, we find that monetary equilibria are generally inefficient in the sense that output and prices differ from the solution to a social planner's problem, although the difference can become small as the discount rate or search friction vanishes.  We also find that there exist nonstationary inflationary equilibria.

AB Regulatory programs that restrict output levels often impose restrictions on the transfer of rights to produce or to use particular inputs.  In this paper, we use a unique cross-section, time-series data set from North Carolina to quantify the welfare effects of transfer restrictions for poundage quota under the U.S. flue-cured tobacco program.  We find that the deadweight costs of such restrictions are small but that the distributional effects are substantial.  We analyze congressional testimony on quota transfer legislation and conclude that our estimates of the distributional effects are consistent with expressed views of market participants.

   MONETARY-POLICY; EXCHANGE-RATE; INFLATION; MONEY; DEMAND; STABILIZATION;
   INFORMATION; REPUTATION
AB This paper addresses the issue of credibility from an econometric perspective.  It develops a rational expectations model of inflation in which the dynamics are driven by the level of government spending and by the effect of past inflation rates on the value of real taxes.  Government expenditure is modeled as an exogenous autoregressive process subject to discrete changes in regime.  The regimes are defined by whether the level of spending is or is not consistent with the rate of inflation targeted by the government as part of a stabilization program.  In making their money demand decision, the agents need to construct probability inferences regarding the state of the expenditure process.  Credibility is quantified by the agents' inferred probability that the joint observation of inflation, the nominal interest rate, and government spending is generated by the reformed expenditure regime.  In an application to Israel, results indicate that the failed stabilization program of November 1984 was less than fully credible to the agents.  The uncertainty about the true nature of the expenditure process partially explains the volatility of the rate of inflation in this period.  In contrast, for the July 1985 program the agents correctly inferred a change in the regime driving the government spending process.

AB This paper reports the results of a statistical summary of estimates of the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for reducing particulate matter from hedonic property value models developed between 1967 and 1988. Results using both ordinary least squares and minimum absolute deviation estimators suggest that market conditions and the procedures used to implement the hedonic models were important to the resulting MWTP estimates. The interquartile range for these estimated marginal values (measured as a change in asset prices) lies between zero and $98.52 (in 1982-84 dollars) for a one-unit reduction in total suspended particulates (in micrograms per cubic meter). The mean MWTP is nearly five times the median ($109.90 vs. $22.40), suggesting that outliers are important influences to any summary statistics for these estimates.

AB Experiments on privately provided public goods generally find that subjects are far more cooperative than predicted, while experiments on oligopolies and the commons almost always obtain the Nash-equilibrium predictions, despite being very similar games.  This paper examines whether this difference could be due to the fact that with public goods there is a positive externality, while with the others the externality is negative.  The result of the experiments is that subjects are more willing to cooperate when the externality is positive, even though the potential outcomes are the same.  This suggests a behavioral asymmetry between the warm-glow of doing something good and cold-prickle of doing something bad.

AB The equity premium puzzle refers to the empirical fact that stocks have outperformed bonds over the last century by a surprisingly large margin.  We offer a new explanation based on two behavioral concepts.  First, investors are assumed to be ''loss averse,'' meaning that they are distinctly more sensitive to losses than to gains.  Second, even long-term investors are assumed to evaluate their portfolios frequently.  We dub this combination ''myopic loss aversion.''  Using simulations, we find that the size of the equity premium is consistent with the previously estimated parameters of prospect theory if investors evaluate their portfolios annually.

Despite the players' naive decision rules and the stochastic decision environment, word-of-mouth communication may lead all players to adopt the action that is on average superior.

ID DISINFLATION
AB This paper demonstrates that the behavior of the conventional Phelps-Taylor model of overlapping wage contracts stands in stark contrast with important features of U.S. macro data for inflation and output.  In particular, the Phelps-Taylor specification implies far too little inflation persistence.  We present a new contracting model, in which agents are concerned with relative real wages, that is data-consistent.  In a specification that nests both models, we resoundingly reject the conventional contracting model, but cannot reject the new contracting model.

TI RELATIVE-PRICE CHANGES AS AGGREGATE SUPPLY SHOCKS
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MENU COSTS; INFLATION; MONEY; OUTPUT; MODEL
AB This paper proposes a theory of supply shocks, or shifts in the short-run Phillips curve, based on relative-price changes and frictions in nominal price adjustment.  When price adjustment is costly, firms adjust to large shocks but not to small shocks, and so large shocks have disproportionate effects on the price level.  Therefore, aggregate inflation depends on the distribution of relative-price changes:  inflation rises when the distribution is skewed to the right, and falls when the distribution is skewed to the left.  We show that this theoretical result explains a large fraction of movements in postwar U.S. inflation.  Moreover, our model suggests measures of supply shocks that perform better than traditional measures, such as the relative prices of food and energy.

ID CITIES
AB Using theory, case studies, and cross-country evidence, we investigate the factors behind the concentration of a nation's urban population in a single city.  High tariffs, high costs of internal trade, and low levels of international trade increase the degree of concentration.  Even more clearly, politics (such as the degree of instability) determines urban primacy.  Dictatorships have central cities that are, on average, 50 percent larger than their democratic counterparts.  Using information about the timing of city growth, and a series of instruments, we conclude that the predominant causality is from political factors to urban concentration, not from concentration to political change.

Three basic facts about the data are uncovered.  First, nominal prices are typically fixed for more than one year, although the time between changes is very irregular.  Second, prices change more often during periods of high overall inflation.  Third, when prices do change, the sizes of the changes are widely dispersed.  Both ''large'' and ''small'' changes occur for the same item, and the sizes of these changes do not closely depend on overall inflation.

Several decisions are discussed, including bidding for leases, the government's decision whether to accept the highest bid, the incidence and timing of exploratory drilling, and the formation of bidding consortia.  Equilibrium models of these decisions that emphasize informational and strategic issues and that account for institutional features of the leasing program are analyzed, and their predictions compared to outcomes in the data.

DE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT; MORTALITY; HOSPITAL READMISSION; COMPETING HAZARDS
ID HIP FRACTURE; CASE MIX; SYSTEM; IMPLEMENTATION; IMPACT; CARE
AB This paper examines the effect of prospective payment for hospital care on adverse medical outcomes.  In 1983, the federal government replaced its previous cost-based reimbursement method with a Prospective Payment System, under which reimbursement depends only on the diagnosis of the patient.  Hospitals thus lost the marginal reimbursement they formerly received for providing additional treatments.  In addition, the average price each hospital received for patients with different diagnoses changed.  This paper relates each of these changes to adverse outcomes, with two conclusions.  First, there is a change in the timing of deaths associated with changes in average prices.  In hospitals with price declines, a greater share of deaths occur in the hospital or shortly after discharge, but by one year post-discharge, mortality is no higher.  Second, there is a trend increase in readmission rates caused by the elimination of marginal reimbursement.  This appears to be due to accounting changes on the part of hospitals, however, rather than true changes in morbidity.

AB We consider the allocation of goods in exchange economies with a finite number of agents who may have private information about their preferences.  In such a setting, standard allocation rules such as Walrasian equilibria or rational expectations equilibria are not compatible with individual incentives.  We characterize the set of allocation rules which are incentive compatible, or in other words, the set of strategy-proof social choice functions.  Social choice functions which are strategy-proof are those which can be obtained from trading according to a finite number of pre-specified proportions.  The number of proportions which can be accommodated is proportional to the number of agents.  Such rules are necessarily inefficient, even in the limit as the economy grows.

The mean preserving spread relation between the likelihood ratio distributions derived from the original information systems is found to be sufficient to rank information systems under quite general assumptions about the agent's utility function.  Furthermore, it is shown that the mean preserving spread criterion can be applied to a broader set of information systems than Holmstrom's informativeness criterion and Blackwell's theorem.

In those experiments the dynamics of subjects' strategy choices and the resulting patterns of discrimination among equilibria varied systematically with the rule for determining payoffs and the size of the interacting groups, in ways that are not adequately explained by available methods of analysis.  The model suggests a possible explanation by showing how the dispersion of subjects' beliefs interacts with the learning process to determine the probability distribution of its dynamics and limiting outcome.

We introduce two new concepts:  belief potential of the information system and p-dominance of Nash-equilibria of the game, and show that a Nash-equilibrium is uniquely selected whenever its p-dominance is below the belief potential.  This criterion applies to many-action games, not merely 2 x 2 games.  It also applies to games without dominant strategies, where the set of equilibria is shown to be smaller and simpler than might be initially conjectured.  Finally, the new concepts help understand the circumstances under which the set of equilibria varies with the amount of common knowledge among players.

AB If an agent's preferences over subjectively uncertain acts are consistent with his or her having a subjective probability distribution over the states of nature, then those preferences can induce consistent preferences over ''objectively'' risky lotteries.  Such ''probabilistically sophisticated'' behavior thus allows us to treat decision making under situations of uncertainty in an analogous manner to those under risk.  This paper first characterizes exactly what probabilistic sophistication entails for an agent's beliefs about the likelihood of states of nature.  Secondly, it presents characterizations of probabilistically sophisticated individuals whose induced lottery preferences obey neither the Independence Axiom (unlike Savage (1954, 1972)) nor a monotonicity property that shares some of the nature of Independence (unlike Machina and Schmeidler (1992)).

The first is whether a formal definition and justification of simplicity (parsimony) in scientific inference can be found, and whether an optimal level of simplicity is obtainable.  A definition of simplicity is possible, as are the optimum conditions for the desired degree of simplicity.  The model of inference used here relates Bayesian inference to algorithmic information theory.  Simplicity is examined in the light of induction, the Duhem-Quine thesis, and bounded rationality.  The second issue relates to the role that simplicity might play in econometric modelling.  This is elucidated with some remarks on the 'general to specific' approach to modelling and discussion on the purpose of a model.

A natural framework for such an integrated model is the state space approach, with the optimal combination of preliminary vintages of data and predictions from the DGP model being obtained by application of the Kalman filter.  We show that substantial reductions in the mean square error of preliminary vintages of data on consumers' expenditure can be obtained from this approach.  This provides further evidence that preliminary vintages are not efficient forecasts of the final vintage.

AB This paper investigates the determinants of price quote revisions on the London Stock Exchange for a sample of highly liquid stocks over a two-week settlement period in September 1990.  In our theoretical model the level of optimal price quotes set by market makers are a function of the expected fundamental price, the expected number of liquidity trades and the lagged level of inventories.  The model is used to test for the existence of adverse selection, inventory control and anticipated liquidity trade effects on quote revisions.  Our findings are that while there seems to be some evidence of asymmetric information in our sample, market makers clearly take into account their inventory positions in the stocks in which they make a market, but there is little evidence that market makers exploit liquidity traders.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

ID LABOR
AB This paper tests the hypothesis that rising earnings profiles are a mechanism by which individuals engage in forced saving.  It does this by examining the cross-sectional relationship between overwithholding on income tax payments - behaviour that is consistent with a preference for forced saving - and the slopes of age-earnings profiles.  The forced-saving hypothesis receives support from earnings regression estimates.  Individuals who receive tax refunds are on earnings profiles that are significantly steeper and have significantly lower intercepts.

AB This paper examines capital flows amongst the major industrialised countries with a view to assessing Feldstein and Horioka's claim that international capital mobility is limited.  It argues that saving-investment correlation tests are inherently flawed, and propose an alternative methodology for testing the degree of international capital mobility.  It finds that capital flows have been excessive, in the sense that they are driven by speculative forces rather than by economic fundamentals.

AB The welfare state provides universal insurance for workers against accidents in the workplace.  In equilibrium, this insurance does not generate adverse safety incentives to firms.  Non-internalised insurance makes workers sort themselves nonoptimally to firms, and to choose higher individual effort levels to prevent accidents as compared to insurance schemes that are internalised in the market.  Welfare state insurance may therefore generate higher safety levels than perfect experience rating, not lower.  An optimal income taxation scheme in the welfare state implies progressive taxation.  The optimal tax level increases with the extent of the welfare state.

AB We study the optimal compensation policy for a corruptible inspector, charged with monitoring pollution from a factory.  Our utilitarian approach focuses on the trade-off among corruption, pollution, and enforcement effort.  Owing to the strategic interaction between factory and inspector, changes in compensation policy have surprising effects, e.g., raising the penalty for corruption may cause pollution to increase.  We find that bribery is an inefficient way of encouraging the inspector to monitor; society should wipe out corruption.

ID FORECLOSURE; ENTRY
AB In an industry where naturally monopolistic and competitive activities are vertically related, should the natural monopolist be allowed also to operate in the deregulated competitive sector?  Unlike much of the literature on vertical integration, this paper assumes that monopoly pricing behaviour is regulated, and therefore the effect of vertical integration on the task of regulation is central to the analysis.  In the model there is both imperfect information and imperfect competition.  When vertical integration by the monopolist is allowed, the regulator's task is made harder insofar as the monopolist has anticompetitive incentives to raise rivals' costs.  On the other hand, integration may lead to there being fewer firms in the deregulated sector and hence less duplication of fixed costs.  The overall welfare comparison between separation and integration is ambiguous, as two simple examples illustrate.  Various extensions to the analysis are also considered.

It focuses on the impact of uncertainty arising from investment in research and exploration-type processes.  It analyses the behaviour of individual firms exploring profit opportunities in an evolving market place and derives optimal policies, including exit, in this environment.  Then it adds an entry process and aggregates the optimal behaviour of all firms, including potential entrants, into a rational expectations, Markov-perfect industry equilibrium, and proves ergodicity of the equilibrium process.  Numerical examples are used to illustrate the more detailed characteristics of the stochastic process generating industry structures that result from this equilibrium.

AB In this paper, we study the optimization problem of an unregulated air carrier which is given the exclusive right to satisfy demand for air travel between any pair of cities.  It chooses a network of connections and a set of prices to maximize profits.  Thus, both network design and prices are endogenous.  We characterize the solution to this optimization problem when demands and costs are symmetric.  Our main result is that, if there are economies of density in the number of individuals travelling between two directly connected cities, the optimal network is either a hub of size n - 1 or one in which every pair of cities is connected directly.

TI ARBITRAGE AND EXISTENCE OF EQUILIBRIUM IN INFINITE ASSET MARKETS
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

ID COMPETITIVE-EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL
AB This paper develops a framework for a general equilibrium analysis of asset markets when the number of assets is infinite.  Such markets have been studied in the context of asset pricing theories.  Our main results concern the existence of an equilibrium.  We show that an equilibrium exists if there is a price system under which no investor has an arbitrage opportunity.  A similar result has been previously known to hold in finite asset markets.  Our extension to infinite assets involves a concept of an arbitrage opportunity which is different from the one used in finite markets.  An arbitrage opportunity in finite asset markets is a portfolio that guarantees non-negative payoff in every event, positive payoff in some event, and has zero price.  For the case of infinite asset markets, we introduce a concept of sequential arbitrage opportunity which is a sequence of portfolios which increases an investor's utility indefinitely and has zero price in the limit.  We show that a sequential arbitrage opportunity and an arbitrage portfolio are equivalent concepts in finite markets but not in their infinite counterpart.

AB We examine an endogenous growth model in which market frictions are an integral part of the economic environment.  Workers invest in education when young, which raises their productivity once employed.  The level of schooling also acts as a key determinant of the rate of economic growth by influencing workers' ability to accumulate additional human capital on-the-job.  Once schooling is completed, workers search for employment.  The division of the surplus between vacancies and searching workers is characterized, as is the optimal level of education.  The economy may display multiple steady-state growth paths.

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; MODEL
AB When sustained growth depends on establishing an indivisible infrastructure for directly productive activities (DPAs) both discrete and marginal departures from optimal growth can undermine the dynamic efficiency of the market.  Producers' anticipations of paying monopoly fees for infrastructure services dampen their incentive to invest in DPAs and may prevent the economy from reaching a minimal level of activity that would justify investment in a large indivisible infrastructure; and potential investors in infrastructure may be intimidated by the prospect of expropriatory regulation.  Thus a credible prior commitment to effective but fair regulation is necessary for achieving optimal growth.  But it may not be sufficient.  Low-level expectations before the infrastructure is established can be self-fulfilling, indicating a role for coordinative industrial policy.  Investment subsidies, even in conjunction with regulation, cannot induce an efficient equilibrium.

Multiple measurements of schooling levels were also collected to assess the effect of reporting error on the estimated economic returns to schooling.  The data indicate that omitted ability variables do not bias the estimated return to schooling upward, but that measurement error does bias it downward.  Adjustment for measurement error indicates that an additional year of schooling increases wages by 12-16 percent, a higher estimate of the economic returns to schooling than has been previously found.

Plain people earn less than average-looking people, who earn less than the good-looking.  The plainness penalty is 5-10 percent, slightly larger than the beauty premium.  Effects for men are at least as great as for women.  Unattractive women have lower labor-force participation rates and marry men with less human capital.   Better-looking people sort into occupations where beauty may be more productive; but the impact of individuals' looks is mostly independent of occupation, suggesting the existence of pure employer discrimination.

The empirical results, obtained from two longitudinal data sets, indicate that the parents view a dollar of income earned by their daughters as equivalent to a dollar increase in welfare benefits.  However, there exists only a small trade-off between the generosity of government aid and the incidence of parental aid.

AB When the patent on a drug expires, there are substantial welfare gains to those consumers who, like the Food and Drug Administration, regard branded and generic versions as perfect substitutes.  Standard price indexes fail to reflect this, since they treat generics as distinct new goods and ''link them in'' with fixed weights.  Alternative calculations are presented, using detailed data on the wholesale prices of two anti-infective drugs.  Significant differences are found:  for one of the drugs studied the standard price index rose by 14 percent over 45 months following patent expiration, while our preferred alternative index fell by 48 percent.

AB This paper examines the effects of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) on private and national saving. We construct a formal model of dynamic utility maximization that generates closed-form equations for IRA and other saving. Our empirical estimates indicate that raising the annual IRA contribution limit between 1983 and 1986 would have resulted in little, if any, increase in national saving. Results from sensitivity analysis imply substantially smaller effects on national saving than most previous researchers have estimated. Our results are consistent with new evidence we present indicating considerable potential among IRA holders to shift taxable forms of saving into IRAs.

AB The probability that an unskilled worker can be successfully trained or screened to be a manager depends on the effort of the firm.  With positive hiring costs, a firm prefers to train/screen its own managers.  However, the optimal size of the firm for productive efficiency may conflict with efficient managerial husbandry.  How a firm copes with the above constraint generates stochastic layoffs, lateral mobility, promotions, diverse earnings profiles, fast-track jobs, and up-or-out rules.

AB This paper explores the interactions between domestic politics and international conflict.  The analysis shows that electoral uncertainty associated with competition between political parties, each representing a specific group of the electorate, imparts a negative ''bias'' on the nation's military spending, given military spending by other nations.  In turn, electoral uncertainty lowers other nations' incentive to arm as well.  In this context, democratic institutions can be thought of as a possible ''precommitment'' mechanism that reduces the severity of conflict between nations and, thereby, increases the amount of resources available globally for consumption.

AB This paper develops a continuous-time stochastic model in which international risk-sharing can yield substantial welfare gains through its effect on expected consumption growth.  The mechanism linking global diversification to growth is an attendant world portfolio shift from safe low-yield capital to riskier high-yield capital.  The presence of these two types of capital captures the idea that growth depends on the availability of an ever-increasing array of specialized, hence inherently risky, production inputs.  Calibration exercises using consumption and stock-market data imply that most countries reap large steady-state welfare gains from global financial integration.

ID DIVERSIFICATION; RENEGOTIATION; CONTRACTS; AGENCY; COSTS
AB Firms often concentrate on a narrow range of activities and claim to forgo other, apparently profitable, opportunities.  This pursuit of narrow strategies is applauded by some academics who study strategic management.  We present two related theoretical models in which firms do indeed benefit from pursuing such narrow strategies.  In these models, a narrow strategy is beneficial because it enables the firm to motivate its employees to search for ways of increasing the profitability of its core activities.  These benefits arise in our model because an incompleteness of contracts precludes offering similar incentives when the firm is involved in many activities.

ID PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH
AB We investigate industry response to cyclical variations in demand. Production units that embody the newest process and product innovations are continuously being created, and outdated units are being destroyed. Although outdated units are the most likely to turn unprofitable and be scrapped in a recession, they can be ''insulated'' from the fall in demand by a reduction in creation. The structure of adjustment costs plays a determinant role in the responsiveness of those two margins. The calibrated model matches the relative volatilities of the observed manufacturing job creation and destruction series, and their asymmetries over the cycle.

AB This paper extends the theory of investment under uncertainty to incorporate fixed costs of investment, a wedge between the purchase price and sale price of capital, and potential irreversibility of investment.  In this extended framework, investment is a nondecreasing function of q, the shadow price of installed capital.  The optimal rate of investment is in one of three regimes (positive, zero, or negative gross investment), depending on the value of q relative to two critical values.  In general however, the shadow price q is not directly observable, so we present two examples relating q to observable variables.

AB Real price variability depreciates the information about future prices contained in current ones.  Repeat-purchase customers have, then, less incentive to acquire price information.  The fact that consumers are less well informed allows firms to increase their markups and permits inefficient producers to increase their sales.  Production gets reallocated toward higher-cost firms.  Given the well-documented correlation between inflation and relative price variability, these results help explain some of the costs of inflation.

AB There is evidence from several sources that one cannot treat many-person households as a single decision maker.  If this is the case, then factors such as the relative incomes of the household members may affect the final allocation decisions made by the household.  We develop a method of identifying how ''incomes affect outcomes'' given conventional family expenditure data.  The basic assumption we make is that household decision processes lead to efficient outcomes.  We apply our method to a sample of Canadian couples with no children.  We find that the final allocations of expenditures on each partner depend significantly on their relative incomes and ages and on the level of lifetime wealth.

AB We develop a model in which a large investor has access to a costly monitoring technology affecting securities' expected payoffs.  Allocations of shares are determined through trading among risk-averse investors.  Despite the free-rider problem associated with monitoring, risk-sharing considerations lead to equilibria in which monitoring takes place.  Under certain conditions the equilibrium allocation is Pareto efficient and all agents hold the market portfolio of risky assets independent of the specific monitoring technology.  Otherwise distortions in risk sharing may occur, and monitoring activities that reduce the expected payoff on the market portfolio may be undertaken.

AB We show how comparisons between the within-twin correlations of human capital outcomes across identical and nonidentical twins can be used to identify the variability in the individual-specific component of endowments and the responsiveness of schooling to individual-specific endowments in the family and in the marriage market even when schooling is measured with error.  Estimates from two twins samples indicate that 27 (42) percent of the variance in log earnings (obesity) is due to variability in individual-specific endowments, allocations of schooling reinforce specific endowments, and individual-specific earnings endowments of men and their wives' schooling are negatively associated.

ID INCENTIVES
AB The empirical literature on executive compensation generally fails to specify a model of executive pay on which to base and test hypotheses regarding its determinants.  In contrast, this paper analyzes a simple principal-agent model to determine how well it explains variations in CEO incentive pay and salaries.  Many findings are consistent with the basic intuition of principal-agent models that compensation is structured to trade off incentives with insurance.  However, statistical significance for some of the effects is weak, although the magnitudes are large.  Also, there is little evidence of the use of relative performance pay.  Nevertheless, while puzzles remain, it seems clear that principal-agent considerations play a role in setting executive compensation.

TI LEARNING-BY-DOING SPILLOVERS IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY

ID MARKET PERFORMANCE; CURVE; GROWTH
AB The semiconductor industry is often cited as a ''strategic'' industry in part because important learning-by-doing spillovers may justify special industrial policies.  Documenting the precise nature of these spillovers is crucial for determining the advisability of such policies and is helpful for understanding the contribution of learning to endogenous growth.  Yet existing empirical evidence on learning by doing in semiconductor production is scant and evidence on spillovers is nonexistent.  Using quarterly, firm-level data on seven generations of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) semiconductors over 1974-92, we find that (a) learning rates average 20 percent, (b) firms learn three times more from an additional unit of their own cumulative production than from an additional unit of another firm's cumulative production, (c) learning spills over just as much between firms in different countries as between firms within a given country, (d) Japanese firms are indistinguishable from others in learning speed, and (e) intergenerational learning spillovers are weak, being marginally significant in only two of seven DRAM generations.

ID TIME-SERIES FACTS
AB It is currently popular to identify monetary policy shocks with innovations in some measure of reserves or in the federal funds rate.  These assumptions about the interest elasticity of the supply of or demand for reserves imply monetary policy shocks that produce dynamic responses of macroeconomic variables that are anomalous relative to traditional monetary analyses.  This paper tentatively identifies supply and demand shocks in the markets for reserves and M2 for the 1980s and contrasts them with results for the 1970s.  In the later period, identified monetary policy shocks have dynamic impacts that are fully consistent with traditional analyses.

This negative relation holds for different diversification measures and when we control for other known determinants of q.  Further, diversified firms have lower q's than comparable portfolios of pure-play firms.  Firms that choose to diversify are poor performers relative to firms that do not, but there is only weak evidence that they have lower q's than the average firm in their industry.  We find no evidence supportive of the view that diversification provides firms with a valuable intangible asset.

AB Many alternative theories have been proposed to explain violations of expected utility (EU) theory observed in experiments.  Several recent studies test some of these alternative theories against each other.  Formal tests used to judge the theories usually count the number of responses consistent with the theory, ignoring systematic variation in responses that are inconsistent.  We develop a maximum-likelihood estimation method which uses all the information in the data, creates test statistics that can be aggregated across studies, and enables one to judge the predictive utility-the fit and parsimony-of utility theories.  Analyses of 23 data sets, using several thousand choices, suggest a menu of theories which sacrifice the least parsimony for the biggest improvement in fit.  The menu is:  mixed fanning, prospect theory, EU, and expected value.  Which theories are best is highly sensitive to whether gambles in a pair have the same support (EU fits better) or not (EU fits poorly).  Our method may have application to other domains in which various theories predict different subsets of choices (e.g., refinements of Nash equilibrium in noncooperative games).

This paper explores the structure of no trade theorems with heterogeneous prior beliefs.  It is shown how different notions of efficiency under asymmetric information-ex ante, interim, ex post-are related to agents' prior beliefs, as well as incentive compatible and public versions of those efficiency concepts.  These efficiency results are used to characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on agents' beliefs for no trade theorems in different trading environments.

AB The purpose of this paper is the presentation of a general formula for the asymptotic variance of a semiparametric estimator.  A particularly important feature of this formula is a way of accounting for the presence of nonparametric estimates of nuisance functions.  The general form of an adjustment factor for nonparametric estimates is derived and analyzed.
   The usefulness of the formula is illustrated by deriving propositions on invariance of the limiting distribution with respect to the nonparametric estimator, conditions for nonparametric estimation to have no effect on the asymptotic distribution, and the form of a correction term for the presence of nonparametric projection and density estimators.  Examples discussed are quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of index models, panel probit with semiparametric individual effects, average derivatives, and inverse density weighted least squares.
   The paper also develops a set of regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic variance formula.  Primitive regularity conditions are derived for square-rootn-consistency and asymptotic normality for functions of series estimators of projections.  Specific examples are polynomial estimators of average derivative and semiparametric panel probit models.

For example, the results apply to tests of one-time structural change with unknown change-point.  Several other examples are discussed in the paper.  The results of the paper are of interest, because the testing problem considered is nonstandard and the classical asymptotic optimality results for the Lagrange multiplier (LM), Wald, and likelihood ratio (LR) tests do not apply.
   A weighted average power criterion is used here to generate optimal tests.  This criterion is similar to that used by Wald (1943) to obtain the classical asymptotic optimality properties of Wald tests in ''regular'' testing problems.  In fact, the optimal tests introduced here reduce to the standard LM, Wald, and LR tests when standard regularity conditions hold.  Nevertheless, in the nonstandard cases of main interest, new optimal tests are obtained and the LR test is not found to be an optimal test.

AB We analyze a first-price, sealed bid auction with a random reservation price to study the federal sales of offshore oil and gas leases on drainage tracts.  Our model assumes the object to be sold has an unknown common value, but one buyer has better information than the others.  We permit the reservation price to be correlated with the information of the informed buyer, which reflects both his assessment of the value of the object and the probability of rejection at any bid.  Assuming all random variables are affiliated, we establish the following results.  (i) The percentage rate of increase in the distribution of the uninformed bid is never greater than the percentage rate of increase of the distribution of the informed bid.  (ii) The distributions are identical at bids above the support of the reservation price.  (iii) The informed buyer is more likely to submit low bids.  We demonstrate that bid data from the federal sales of offshore drainage leases satisfy these restrictions.

We use 15 years of Family Expenditure Surveys, and cohort analysis, to investigate to what extent these two hypotheses agree with observed changes in consumption patterns.  We find that the housing markets explanation accounts for much of the increase by older cohorts, but cannot be reconciled with the marked rise in expenditure levels of younger households.  A simple simulation exercise shows instead that the expectations hypothesis can generate increases of expenditure by young consumers of the magnitude observed in our data.

The economy is shown to display cyclical asymmetries; stochastic properties of variables such as employment, unemployment, real wages and the unemployment-vacancy ratio crucially depend upon the state of the business cycle.  We show that in most cases conditioning on the state of the cycle removes residual non-linearities and is more successful than the linear and a number of non-linear time-series models.  The robustness of our findings is confirmed using a variety of diagnostics and alternative measures of the cycle.

ID TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; ADJUSTMENT; CONSUMPTION; TESTS; COINTEGRATION;
   INCOME; TRENDS; CYCLE
AB We examine the implications of treating seasonality as an unobserved component which changes slowly over time.  This approach simplifies the specification of dynamic relationships by separating non-seasonal from seasonal factors.  We illustrate this approach using the consumption model of Davidson et al. (1978), estimating a stable error correction model between consumption, income and prices over the period 1958-92.  More generally, we argue that autoregressive models are unlikely to model slowly changing seasonality successfully, and may confound seasonal effects with the dynamic responses of prime interest.  Our approach can be used in a wide range of cases and involves little loss in efficiency even if seasonality is deterministic.

TI TRANSFER BENEFITS FROM PUBLIC-WORKS EMPLOYMENT - EVIDENCE FOR RURAL
   INDIA
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Current knowledge provides little guidance on one of the key questions in evaluating public employment schemes aimed at directly reducing poverty:  What are the net income gains to participating workers?  This paper offers an answer for rural public employment in two villages in the state of Maharashtra in India.  A model of intra-household time allocation is proposed, and estimates are made using household data over six years.  The empirical implementation indicates that the projects induce significant behavioural responses.  Transfer benefits are large, and are greatly underestimated using prevailing market wage rates for similar work to estimate forgone incomes.

AB Preference reversal has been frequent in tests with hypothetical, or small real, payoffs concerning lotteries as well as claims redeemable at different future dates.  PR is tested here for the latter case with nontrivial payment levels and subjects likely to deal with decisions of this type.  It is found (1) that replacing hypothetical by real-payment tests reduces PR rates from 62% to 15% for subjects 'predicted' to reverse preferences, and (2) that the real overall PR rate (before correcting for response errors) is 19%, much lower than in earlier studies.

TI PHASING IN AND PHASING OUT PROTECTIONISM WITH COSTLY ADJUSTMENT OF LABOR
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

DT Article
AB We study the dynamics of optimal trade policy in a model with costly inter-sectoral adjustment of labour, where migrants pay less than the marginal social cost of migration.  If workers have rational expectations, a future tariff has an announcement effect on the current migration decision.  If the government is able to commit itself to future policy, the optimal trajectory involves phasing in and then phasing out protection of the dying sector.  This contrasts with recommendations of gradual liberalisation.  Without the ability to make commitments, the equilibrium policy begins with and maintains free trade.

ID INCREASING RETURNS; RESOURCES
AB This article analyses the potential conflict between economic growth and the maintenance of environmental quality in an overlapping generations model.  Short-lived individuals make decisions which have long-lasting effects on both factor productivity and the environment.  The model provides a theoretical explanation of observed correlations between environmental quality and income, whereby economic growth is associated first with declines, then improvements, in environmental quality.  It suggests circumstances in which multiple Pareto-ranked steady-state equilibria may arise, and in which sustained growth of both capital and environmental quality may occur.  Overmaintenance of the environment, analogous to dynamically inefficient over-accumulation of capital, may emerge.

ID ORGANIZATION; HIERARCHIES; COSTS
AB This paper analyzes how organizations can minimize costs of processing and communicating information.  Communication is costly because it takes time for an agent to absorb new information sent by others.  Agents can reduce this time by specializing in the processing of particular types of information.  When these returns to specialization outweigh costs of communication, it is efficient for several agents to collaborate within a firm.  It is shown that efficient networks involve centralization, that individuals delegate tasks to subordinates only if they are overloaded, and that the number of transits to the top tends to be equalized across individual information items.

AB Consider an entrepreneur who needs to raise funds from an investor, but cannot commit not to withdraw his human capital from the project.  The possibility of a default or quit puts an upper bound on the total future indebtedness from the entrepreneur to the investor at any date.  We characterize the optimal repayment path and show how it is affected both by the maturity structure of the project return stream and by the durability and specificity of project assets.  Our results are consistent with the conventional wisdom about what determines the maturity structure of long-term debt contracts.

Career movements suggest that the employee's rate of learning and the firm's learning about ability are important.  There are promotion ''fast tracks.''  Exit rates vary little with tenure or salary.  The firm has personnel policies like those described in the internal labor markets literature, although several theoretical preconditions for ILMs, such as ports of entry and exit, are lacking.  Job levels are important to compensation, but there is also substantial individual variation in pay within levels.  Our companion paper (in this issue) explores the wage policy of this firm.

AB Salary data from a single firm are analyzed in an effort to identify the firm's wage policy.  We find that employees are partly shielded against changes in external market conditions; that wage variation within a job level is large both cross-sectionally and for individuals over time, often leading to substantial real wage declines; that wage increases are serially correlated even controlling for observable characteristics; and that promotions and wage growth are strongly related, even though promotion premiums are small relative to the large wage differences between job levels.  None of the major theories of wage determination can alone explain the evidence.

This framework is used to compare the market rule, which is followed in the United States, with the equal opportunity rule, which is used in many other countries.  The market rule is superior to the equal opportunity rule in facilitating efficient transfers of control but inferior to it in discouraging inefficient transfers.  Conditions under which one of the two rules is overall superior are identified; for example, the market rule is superior if existing and new controllers draw their characteristics from the same distributions.  Finally, the rules' effects on surplus division are analyzed, and this examination reveals a rationale for mandatory rules.

The theory rationalizes (1) the multiplicity of securities, (2) the observed correlation between return streams and control rights of securities, and (3) the partial congruence between managerial and equity-holder preferences over policy choices and monetary rewards as well as the low level of interference of equity in management.  The theory also offers new prospects for a reappraisal of the earlier corporate finance literature.

AB We study the problem of financial contracting and renegotiation between a firm and outside investors when the firm cannot commit to future payouts, but assets can be contracted upon.  We show that a capital structure with multiple investors specializing in short-term and long-term claims is superior to a structure with only one type of claim, because this hardens the incentives for the entrepreneur to renegotiate the contract ex post.  Depending on the parameters, the optimal capital structure also differentiates between state-independent and state-dependent long-term claims, which can be interpreted as long-term debt and equity.

TI INCOMPLETE WRITTEN CONTRACTS - INDESCRIBABLE STATES OF NATURE
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the extent to which the incompleteness of contracts can be attributed to their formal nature:  the form, usually written, that contracts are required to take to be enforceable in a court of law by legal prescription, common practice, or simply the contracting parties' will.  We model the formal nature of state-contingent contracts as the requirement that the mapping from states of the world to the corresponding outcomes must be of an algorithmic nature.  It is shown that such algorithmic nature, although by itself is not enough to generate incomplete contracts, when paired with a similar restriction on the contracting parties' selection process yields endogenously incomplete optimal contracts.

ID IMPLICIT CONTRACTS; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB Incentive contracts often include important subjective components that mitigate incentive distortions caused by imperfect objective measures.  This paper explores the combined use of subjective and objective performance measures in (respectively) implicit and explicit incentive contracts.  We show that the presence of sufficiently effective explicit contracts can render all implicit contracts infeasible, even those that would otherwise yield the first-best.  We also show, however, that in some circumstances objective and subjective measures are complements:  neither an explicit nor an implicit contract alone yields positive profit, but an appropriate combination of the two does.  Finally, we consider subjective weights on objective measures.

AB We analyze optimal task assignment when a firm needs to learn the abilities of employees.  When projects require collaboration between juniors and seniors and only team outputs are observable, having juniors divide their time between two projects (''junior sharing'') is less informative about their abilities, but more informative about their senior teammates' abilities, than having juniors devote all their time to a single project (''no sharing'').  In an overlapping-generations model, we show that no sharing is more (less) attractive than junior sharing if the prior uncertainty about abilities is small (large) relative to exogenous shocks to team production.

TI INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL CAPITAL-MARKETS
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

AB This paper presents a framework for analyzing the costs and benefits of internal versus external capital allocation.  We focus primarily on comparing an internal capital market with bank lending.  While both represent centralized forms of financing, in the former case the financing is owner-provided, while in the latter case it is not.  We argue that the ownership aspect of internal capital allocation has three important consequences:  (1) it leads to more monitoring than bank lending; (2) it reduces managers' entrepreneurial incentives; and (3) it makes it easier to efficiently redeploy the assets of projects that are performing poorly under existing management.

TI A THEORY OF CONFORMITY
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATEGIC STABILITY; SIGNALING GAMES; EQUILIBRIA; CUSTOM
AB This paper analyzes a model of social interaction in which individuals care about status as well as ''intrinsic'' utility (which refers to utility derived directly from consumption).  Status is assumed to depend on public perceptions about an individual's predispositions rather than on the individual's actions.  However, since predispositions are unobservable, actions signal predispositions and therefore affect status.  When status is sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals conform to a single, homogeneous standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous underlying preferences.  They are willing to conform because they recognize that even small departures from the social norm will seriously impair their status.  The fact that society harshly censures all nonconformists is not simply assumed (indeed, status varies smoothly with perceived type); rather, it is produced endogeneously.  Despite this penalty, agents with sufficiently extreme preferences refuse to conform.  The model provides an explanation for the fact that standards of behavior govern some activities but do not govern others.  It also suggests a theory of how standards of behavior might evolve in response to changes in the distribution of intrinsic preferences.  In particular, for some values of the preference parameters, norms are both persistent and widely followed; for other values, norms are transitory and confined to small groups.  Thus the model produces both customs and fads.  Finally, an extension of the model suggests an explanation for the development of multiple subcultures, each with its own distinct norm.

AB College enrollment of black 18-19-year-old high school graduates declined from 1980 through 1984 and then rebounded after 1984.  This paper presents data from a time series of cross sections of 18-19-year-old youths from 1973 through 1988 to test the role of family background, direct college costs, local economic conditions, and returns to college in driving these trends.  The evidence suggests that, on the one hand, increases in direct college costs were driving enrollment rates downward throughout the eighties.  On the other hand, dramatic increases in average parental education for black youths exerted upward pressure on college enrollment by blacks, particularly in the latter half of the decade.  The net effect of these two factors contributed to the pattern of decline and recovery observed during the eighties.

AB Lacking an appropriate theoretical framework, economists and economic historians have paid little attention to the relations between culture and institutional structure.  This limits the ability to address a question that seems to be at the heart of development failures:  Why do societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically successful ones?  This paper integrates game-theoretical and sociological concepts to conduct a comparative historical analysis of the relations between culture and institutional structure.  It examines cultural factors that have led two premodern societies-one from the Muslim world and the other from the Latin world-to evolve along distinct trajectories of institutional structure.  It indicates the theoretical importance of culture in determining institutional structures, in leading to their path dependence, and in forestalling successful intersociety adoption of institutions.  Since the distinct institutional structures found in the late medieval period resemble those differentiating contemporary developing and developed economics, the paper suggests the historical importance of distinct cultures in economic development.

TI ECONOMIC-IMPACTS OF THE CALIFORNIA-ONE-VARIETY-COTTON-LAW
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETITION
AB The California One-Variety Cotton Law is an important example of technological regulation, in this case intended to serve as a de facto quality control and to mitigate externalities in production that can arise from the mixing of cottonseed at the gin.  This paper describes and interprets the economic history of the law, presents a theoretical model of its economic effects, and provides quantitative estimates of the impacts on output, prices, and economic welfare, following a partial deregulation under a 1978 amendment to the law.  The analysis shows that large social costs have arisen from concentrating control over the genetic base for California cotton production in the hands of a single government cotton breeder and restricting production to the use of a single selection of a single variety.  Some of these costs have been eliminated by the partial deregulation in 1978 to permit private breeders to compete in the provision of genetic material, but production is still restricted to the Acala variety of cotton.  While the regulation has benefited some, perhaps even a majority, of the industry participants, it has been increasingly harmful to some other growers and costly overall.  The persistence of this costly regulation may be due to the distribution of its impacts:  the partial deregulation yielded large increases in aggregate producer surplus but many growers experienced small losses.

AB We focus on the effect of state versus private ownership on the rates of firm-specific productivity growth and cost decline by developing a model of endogenous, firm-specific productivity growth and testing its implications against panel data on 23 international airlines of varying levels of state ownership over the period 1973-83.  Our model and empirical results show that state ownership can lower the long-run annual rate of productivity growth or cost decline, but not necessarily their levels in the short run.  Observed level differences in productive efficiency across private and state-owned firms may thus be a function of the age distribution of the firms being compared.  These results appear to be independent of whether the firms operate under apparently more or less competitive or regulated markets and whether they differ in production scales.  The analysis offers new insights concerning the recent trend toward privatizing state-owned enterprises that has been observed in many countries.

For less harmful acts, marginal expected penalties ought to fall short of marginal harms caused.  Indeed, some range of very minor acts should be legalized.  For more harmful acts, whether marginal expected penalties should fall short of, or exceed, marginal harms depends on the balance between monitoring and prosecution/punishment costs.  We also explore how the optimal enforcement policy varies with changes in these costs.

AB The semiparametric efficiency bound of the mixed proportional hazard model is derived.  The density of the model factors in such a way that there exists a complete sufficient statistic for the individual heterogeneity.  The efficient score is shown to be the difference between the score in the parametric direction and its conditional expectation given the sufficient statistic.  Applying this result to the single-spell Weibull mixed proportional hazard model, it is shown that its information matrix is singular and there cannot exist any square-root n-consistent estimator sequence.  The information of the multi-spell Weibull mixed proportional hazard model is shown to be nonsingular in general.

The paper builds on the models concerning the distribution of income or consumption and incentive problems of Green (1987), Thomas and Worrall (1991), Phelan and Townsend (1991), and Atkeson and Lucas (1992).  By incorporating aggregate production shocks, the model allows an examination of the interactions between individual and aggregate consumption series given incomplete insurance.  Further, the methodology outlined allows the incorporation of incentive considerations to macroeconomic environments similar to Rogerson (1988) and Hansen (1985).

TI ROTATING SAVINGS AND CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT MARKETS AND EFFICIENCY
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the allocative performance of rotating savings and credit associations (roscas), a financial institution which is observed world-wide.  We develop a model in which individuals save for an indivisible good and study roscas which distribute funds using random allocation and bidding.  The allocations achieved by the two types of rosca are compared with that achieved by a credit market and with efficient allocations more generally.  We find that neither type of rosca is efficient and that individuals are better off with a credit market than a bidding rosca.  Nonetheless, a random rosca may sometimes yield a higher level of ex ante expected utility to prospective participants than would a credit market.

   CREDIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY
AB This paper considers the optimal approach to reducing inflation when the cost of inflation is its conditional variability.  Inflation is stochastically related to money growth, with unobservable time-varying autonomous and induced components.  A sharp reduction in money growth provides information about the responsiveness of inflation to money, but also induces variability as the economy heads into unknown territory.  Gradual policy is always optimal and the model explains why moderate-inflation countries adopt a much more gradual money growth reduction than high-inflation countries.  Additionally, the analysis sheds light on the more general problem of learning with two unobservable parameters.

TI OPTIMAL INCOME-DISTRIBUTION RULES AND REPRESENTATIVE CONSUMERS
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEMAND; AGGREGATION
AB This paper derives observable properties of economies with optimal income distribution rules that specify consumers' incomes as functions of aggregate income and prices.  Optimality implies that the aggregate demand function is generated by a single ''representative'' consumer, cf. Samuelson (1956).  We derive an additional implication which, when consumers receive fixed shares of aggregate income, requires that the consumers' demands become more dispersed when aggregate income rises.  This last condition has empirical support.  The results relate the representative consumer's preferences to a version of Kaldor's compensation criterion and show when both can be used for normative analysis without internal inconsistency.

AB In a signal-extraction model of consumer behaviour, higher prices signal higher-quality products for a new product monopoly, even without cost asymmetries across different qualities.  Moreover, higher-quality products earn greater expected profits, and the monopolist has an incentive to provide even transient improvements in quality.  Finally, the monopolist has a positive incentive to conduct market research about quality, and produces more information than is socially optimal.

ID CLIMATE CHANGE
AB We measure the economic impact of climate on land prices. Using cross-sectional data on climate, farmland prices, and other economic and geophysical data for almost 3,000 counties in the United States, we find that higher temperatures in all seasons except autumn reduce average farm values, while more precipitation outside of autumn increases farm values. Applying the model to a global-warming scenario shows a significantly lower estimated impact of global warming on U.S. agriculture than the traditional production-function approach and, in one case, suggests that, even without CO2 fertilization, global warming may have economic benefits for agriculture.

AB On April 1, 1992, New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. We also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. We find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.

The estimated effect of permanent change is substantially smaller than the effect of transitory change. The difference is even larger than differences between estimates from past micro data studies, which have primarily measured the transitory effect, and time-series studies, which have primarily measured the permanent effect. Our results resolve a long-standing conflict between micro data and time-series studies of how marginal tax rates affect capital-gains realizations behavior.

ID INFORMATION
AB The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 removed commercial banks from the securities underwriting business. We evaluate the argument for the separation of commercial and investment banking, that conflicts of interest induce commercial banks to fool the public into investing in securities which tum out to be of low quality. A comparison of the performance of securities underwritten by commercial and investment banks prior to the Act shows no evidence of this. Instead, the public appears to have rationally accounted for the possibility of conflicts of interest, and this appears to have constrained the banks to underwrite high-quality securities.

AB We develop a model in which special-interest groups make political contributions in order to influence an incumbent government's choice of trade policy. The interest groups bid for protection with their campaign support. Politicians maximize their own welfare, which depends on total contributions collected and on the welfare of voters. We study the structure of protection that emerges in the political equilibrium and the contributions by different lobbies that support the policy outcome. We also discuss why the lobbies may in some cases prefer to have the government use trade policy to transfer income, rather than more efficient means.

AB Differences in property rights create a motive for trade among otherwise identical regions. Two regions with identical technologies, endowments, and preferences will trade if one, the South, has ill-defined property rights on environmental resources. Trade with a region with well-defined property rights transmits and enlarges the problem of the commons: the North overconsumes underpriced resource-intensive products imported from the South. This occurs even though trade equalizes all prices, of goods and factors, worldwide. Taxing the use of resources in the South is unreliable as it can lead to more overextraction. Property-rights policies may be more effective.

AB In this paper we investigate the implications of flexible manufacturing for market structure. In the received theory of market structure, based largely on inflexible techniques of production, a number of well-known forces work to limit concentration. In our model none of these forces exists. Hence, we conclude that flexible manufacturing promotes concentration through preemption and mergers, or equivalently through cartels. Interestingly, the concentrated market structures associated with flexibility may or may not be welfare-dominated by a regime in which monopolization is not allowed.

Decisions of this type include land-redevelopment decisions where the density of residential or commercial development is a choice variable as well as capital-replacement decisions where capacity is variable. We provide a general yet simple formulation of the problem using an optimal-stopping framework. We characterize the value of the project, the timing of investment, and the intensity of development. We show that intensity interacts in important ways with timing, taxes, and project values. The ability to vary intensity raises hurdle rents and delays development decisions.

When prices become volatile, shocks to liquidity and fundamentals may occur between the time investors decide to trade and the time their orders are executed This gives rise to implementation risk that cannot be transferred with contingent claims. We show that price limits partially insure implementation risk. When price fluctuations are driven by news about fundamentals, judiciously chosen price limits can be (ex ante) Pareto superior to unconstrained trade. When liquidity shocks are large, price limits benefit hedgers but harm some speculators.

AB Traditional asset-pricing theories assume complete market participation, despite considerable empirical evidence that most investors participate in a limited number of markets. We show that once the participation decision is endogenized, market properties change dramatically. First, limited market participation can amplify the effect of liquidity trading relative to full participation; under certain circumstances, an arbitrarily small aggregate liquidity shock can cause significant price volatility. Second, there exist multiple equilibria with very different participation regimes and levels of asset-price volatility. Third, under plausible conditions the equilibria can be Pareto-ranked; the Pareto-preferred equilibrium is characterized by greater participation and lower volatility.

I show that more egalitarian policymakers set lower standards, the median voter would prefer higher standards (under symmetric distributions), and decentralization lowers standards (among identical communities). Optimal standards do not necessarily fall with increased student preference for leisure, deterioration of nonstudent inputs to education, or increased student heterogeneity. Superseding binary credentials by perfect information increases average achievement and social welfare, for plausible degrees of heterogeneity, egalitarianism, and pooling under decentralization.

AB This paper concerns the difficulties associated with establishing a time at which a market will operate. We first describe the experience of several dozen markets and submarkets, from entry-level professional labor markets in the United States, Canada, England, and Japan, to the (American) market for postseason college football bowls. The difficulties these markets have experienced in coordinating the timing of transactions have been decisive in determining how they are organized today. The paper develops a framework in which to address the timing of transactions and the tendency observed in many of these markets for transactions to become earlier and earlier.

AB We study repeated games in which players observe a public outcome that imperfectly signals the actions played. We provide conditions guaranteeing that any feasible, individually rational payoff vector of the stage game can arise as a perfect equilibrium of the repeated game with sufficiently little discounting. The central condition requires that there exist action profiles with the property that, for any two players, no two deviations-one by each player-give rise to the same probability distribution over public outcomes. The results apply to principal-agent, partnership, oligopoly, and mechanism-design models, and to one-shot games with transferable utilities.

AB A model of trade with m buyers and m sellers is considered in which price is set to equate revealed demand and supply. In a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, each trader acts not as a price-taker, but instead misrepresents his true demand/supply to influence price in his favor. This causes inefficiency. We show that in any equilibrium the amount by which a trader misreports is O(1/m) and the corresponding inefficiency is O(1/m2). The indeterminacy and the inefficiency that is caused by the traders' bargaining behavior in small markets thus rapidly vanishes as the market increases in size.

DE INVESTMENT; DELAY; INFORMATIONAL EXTERNALITY
ID UNCERTAINTY; IRREVERSIBILITY; COORDINATION
AB We model investment as an N-player game with a pure informational externality. Each player's payoff depends only on his own action and the state of nature. However, because a player's action reveals his private information, players wait to see what other players will do. Equilibrium is inefficient because delay is costly and information is imperfectly revealed. We characterize the unique symmetric perfect Bayesian equilibrium and study the robustness of delay, which turns out to be sensitive to the reaction speed and the number of players. We establish the following results. (i) When the period length is very short, the game ends very quickly and there is a form of herding or informational cascade which results in a collapse of investment. (ii) As the period length increases, the possibility of herding disappears. (iii) As the number of players increases, the rate of investment and the information flow are eventually independent of the number of players; adding more players simply increases the number who delay. (iv) In the limit, the time-profile of investment is extreme, a period of low investment followed either by an investment surge or a collapse.

We draw on previous work by Kushner and Clark (1978) to provide readily verifiable and/or interpretable conditions ensuring algorithm convergence, chosen for their suitability in the context of adaptive learning.

ID COMPETITION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; INDUSTRIAL; EVOLUTION
AB Strategic implications of the learning curve hypothesis are analyzed in a model of a price-setting, differentiated duopoly selling to a sequence of heterogeneous buyers with uncertain demands. A unique and symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium is characterized, and two concepts of self-reinforcing market dominance investigated. One is increasing dominance (ID), whereby the leading firm has a greater probability of winning the next sale; the other is increasing increasing dominance (IID), whereby a firm's probability of winning the next sale increases with the length of its lead. Sufficient conditions for IID (and thus for ID) are that the discount factor is sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Other sufficient conditions for ID and IID are given in the case of two-step learning, in which a firm reaches the bottom of its learning curve after just two sales. However, examples are also constructed for the two-step learning case in which neither ID nor IID holds. It is also shown that, in equilibrium, IID implies that learning is privately disadvantageous, although it is socially advantageous. Finally, introducing avoidable fixed costs and possible exit into the model yields a new theory of predatory pricing based on the learning curve hypothesis.

AB The author proves an equivalence between large games with effective small groups of players and games generated by markets. Small groups are effective if all or almost all gains to collective activities can be achieved by groups bounded in size. A market is an exchange economy where all participants have concave, quasi-linear payoff functions. The market approximating a game is socially homogeneous-all participants have the same monotonic nondecreasing, and 1-homogeneous payoff function. Our results imply that any market (more generally, any economy with effective small groups) can be approximated by a socially homogeneous market.

DE AXIOMATIC BARGAINING MODELS; GENERALIZED GINI ORDERINGS
ID SOCIAL-WELFARE; AXIOMATIZATION; INEQUALITY; INDEXES
AB This paper introduces and characterizes a new class of solutions to cooperative bargaining problems that can be rationalized by generalized Gini orderings defined on the agents' utility gains. Generalized Ginis are orderings which can be represented by quasi-concave, nondecreasing functions that are linear in rank-ordered subspaces of Euclidean n-space.
   Our characterization of (multi-valued) generalized Gini bargaining solutions is based on a linear invariance requirement in addition to some standard conditions. Linear invariance requires that if the feasible set is changed by adding a constant to one agent's component of each vector of the feasible set (without changing the agent's rank order), the solution responds by adding the same constant to the corresponding agent's utility in the outcome of the problem. Weak linear invariance requires the solution to change in a parallel way if a constant is added to all components of each vector of the feasible set. In the two-person case, the generalized Gini bargaining solutions can be characterized by imposing weak linear invariance, whereas, for n greater-than-or-equal-to 3 agents, linear invariance is required.
   As a by-product of our main result, we show that the egalitarian bargaining solution is characterized if single-valuedness is required together with some of our axioms.
   The main focus of cooperative bargaining theory has been the characterization of single-valued solutions. The results of this paper demonstrate that relaxing this assumption enlarges the class of solutions considerably. Hence, single-valuedness is not merely an assumption of convenience but, rather, an assumption of substance.

The present paper extends this model to cases with both discrete and continuous choice sets and choice sets that are unobservable by the analyst. We also propose behavioral assumptions that justify random utility functions (processes) that have a max-stable structure, i.e., utility processes where the finite-dimensional distributions are of the multivariate extreme value type.
   Finally we derive nonparametrically testable implications for the choice probabilities in the continuous case.

More specifically, tests of point null hypotheses and one- or two-sided alternatives are considered (where nuisance parameters may be present under both hypotheses). It is shown that for certain priors the Bayesian posterior odds test is equivalent in large samples to classical Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood ratio tests for some significance level and vice versa. The priors considered under the alternative hypothesis are taken to shrink to the null hypothesis at rate n-1/2 as the sample size n increases.

AB Following Phillips's original work on the United Kingdom, applied research on unemployment and wages has been dominated by the analysis of highly aggregated time-series data sets.  However, it has proved difficult with such methods to uncover statistically reliable models.  This paper adopts a different approach.  It uses microeconomic data on 175,000 British workers from 1973 to 1990 to provide evidence for the existence of a negatively sloped relationship linking the level of pay to the local rate of unemployment.  The paper casts doubt on standard ideas in macroeconomics, regional economics and labour economics.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

ID PRODUCTIVITY; UNEMPLOYMENT; EMPLOYMENT
AB This paper examines the dynamic relationship between profit sharing and profitability in a sample of U.K. firms during the 1980s.  The estimates indicate a positive short run effect of the introduction of profit sharing schemes on the financial performance of companies.  This relationship is evident even if we control for unobserved firm specific fixed effects and potential endogeneity of profit sharing.  Quite apart from its widely recognised influence on productivity and industrial relations, profit sharing is arguably a financially attractive option for firms.  There is also evidence of the persistence of profitability in U.K. profit sharing firms.

AB Currency substitution has important implications for the cost of European monetary union - if it is significant it will help to reduce costs of convergence to a single currency.  This paper informs the policy debate by testing for its existence on a consistent European database making use of cointegration methods.  The results demonstrate that in the two types of model tested there is no clear evidence of currency substitution, in either the short of the long run, and that therefore currency substitution between sterling and EC currencies cannot be relied upon as a mechanism or an aid to reduce the costs of monetary convergence.

AB In this paper UK disaggregate survey data of expected future interest rates are used to test the expectations model of the term structure of interest rates at the short end of the maturity spectrum.  In the aggregate, the expectations model is rejected, and both time-varying term premia and expected interest rate changes are demonstrated to be important in explaining the slope of the yield curve.  Within the aggregate data, however, we demonstrate that there are some differences with respect to the views of the term structure held.  For example, for some individuals the pure expectations model cannot be rejected.

AB This paper investigates the selection of an equilibrium in an economy with multiple, Pareto-ranked, Nash equilibria.  A history-dependent selection criterion is proposed which induces correlated behavior in equilibrium even though agents are playing one-shot games and disturbances are not correlated over time.  The model economy may experience prolonged periods in which a low productivity technology is in use and then, as a consequence of a large real disturbance, may switch to an alternative equilibrium in which a high productivity technology is utilised.  Thus the model qualitatively matches observations of serially correlated movements in output and employment and generates procyclical productivity though there are no exogenous technology shocks.

AB In modern economies, multiple means of payment associated with the exchange of goods coexist.  This paper examines one such payment system in an economy with endogenous technological change.  It consists of money and a costly accounting system that receives spillovers from new technologies.  Positive nominal interest rates are shown to produce welfare losses by inducing a reallocation of human capital into the payment system, and out of the production of final goods and new knowledge.  The former substitution produces level effects on output and the latter produces growth effects.  At higher levels of inflation, these marginal effects are seen to be weaker.

AB Don Patinkin (1993) and James Meade (1993) explore the relationship among Kahn's multiplier, 'Mr Meade's Relation', and Keynes's theory of effective demand, but do not quote Mr Meade's Relation as it appeared in Kahn (1931).  This note shows that the 1931 version of Mr Meade's Relation did not include a personal saving propensity.  Instead it included other leakages not in the 1993 version.  Attention is drawn to derivation of a finite multiplier using the marginal propensity to save by Meade (1933) and by Ralph Hawtrey.

AB Contrary to Dimand's contention, there is no significant difference between Meade's 1931 and 1933 expositions of the multiplier.  In another respect, however, there is a significant difference between these two expositions and his 1993 exposition, and this is additional evidence that the role of the 1931 Cambridge Circus proper in the development of the General Theory has been exaggerated.  However, by their fruitful criticisms of subsequent drafts of the book, two members of the Circus, Richard Kahn and Joan Robinson, did subsequently play an important role in this development.

ID OPTIMAL TAXATION; GROWTH; FLUCTUATIONS; SAVINGS; ECONOMY; INCOME; TAX
AB This paper develops the quantitative implications of optimal fiscal policy in a business cycle model.  In a stationary equilibrium, the ex ante tax rate on capital income is approximately zero.  There is an equivalence class of ex post capital income tax rates and bond policies that support a given allocation.  Within this class, the optimal ex post capital tax rates can range from close to independently and identically distributed to close to a random walk.  The tax rate on labor income fluctuates very little and inherits the persistence properties of the exogenous shocks; thus there is no presumption that optimal labor tax rates follow a random walk.  Most of the welfare gains realized by switching from a tax system like that of the United States to the Ramsey system come from an initial period of high taxation on capital income.

AB We study dispersion in the prices an airline charges to different passengers on the same route.  This variation in fares is substantial:  the expected absolute difference in fares between two passengers on a route is 36 percent of the airline's average ticket price.  The pattern of observed price dispersion cannot easily be explained by cost differences alone.  Dispersion increases on routes with more competition or lower flight density, consistent with discrimination based on customers' willingness to switch to alternative airlines or flights.  We argue that the data support models of price discrimination in monopolistically competitive markets.

The merchant guild developed the theoretically required attributes, secured merchants' property rights, and evolved in response to crises to extend the range of its effectiveness, contributing to the expansion of trade during the late medieval period.  We elaborate on the relations between our theory and the monopoly theory of merchant guilds and contrast it with repeated-game theories that provide no role for formal organization.

AB Previous studies of congressional spending have typically found a large positive effect of challenger spending but little evidence for effects of incumbent spending.  Those studies, however, do not adequately control for inherent differences in vote-getting ability across candidates.  ''High-quality'' challengers are likely to receive a high fraction of the vote and have high campaign expenditures, even if campaign spending has no impact on election outcomes.  To avoid that bias, this paper examines elections in which the same two candidates face one another on more than one occasion; differencing eliminates the influence of any fixed candidate or district attributes.  Estimates of the effects of challenger spending are an order of magnitude below those of previous studies.  Campaign spending has an extremely small impact on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending.  Campaign spending limits appear socially desirable, but public financing of campaigns does not.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

ID LINE-ITEM VETO; GOVERNMENTS; DETERMINANTS; RESTRAINTS; TAX
AB This paper explores the dynamics of state taxes and spending during the late 1980s, when regional economic downturns and increased expenditure demands led to substantial state budget deficits.  More restrictive state fiscal institutions, such as ''no-deficit-carryover'' rules and tax and expenditure limitations, are correlated with more rapid fiscal adjustment to unexpected deficits.  Political factors are also important.  When a single party controls the state house and the governorship, deficit adjustment is much faster than when party control is divided.  In gubernatorial election years, tax increases and spending cuts are both significantly smaller than at other times.

AB Using a game-theoretic approach, we examine possible equilibrium explanations of the often-observed phenomenon that two neighboring restaurants offering similar menus nevertheless experience vastly different demands.  The essential aspect of this analysis is the presence of a consumption externality that makes the popularity itself a factor in the determination of the relative attractiveness of the restaurants.

AB This paper documents the impact of siblings on the education of men and women born in the United States between 1920 and 1965. We examine the effect of the number and sex composition of a boy or girl's siblings on that child's educational attainment. We find that throughout the century women's educational choices have been systematically affected by the sex composition of her siblings, and that men's choices have not. Women raised only with brothers have received on average significantly more education than women raised with any sisters, controlling for household size. Since sibling sex composition affects women's educational attainment and plausibly may be unrelated to other determinants of earnings, it may. provide a useful instrument for education in earnings functions for women. Our results suggest that standard estimates significantly underestimate the return to schooling for women.

AB This paper examines micro data on U. S. manufacturing firms' inventory behavior during different macroeconomic episodes. Much of the analysis focuses on the 1981-1982 recession, which was apparently caused in large part by tight monetary policy. We find that the inventory investment of firms without access to public bond markets is significantly liquidity-constrained during this period. A similar pattern emerges during the 1974-1975 recession, in which tight money also appears to have played a role. In contrast, such liquidity constraints are largely absent during periods of looser monetary policy in the 1970s and 1980s.

AB This paper examines the short-run dynamics of manufacturing costs by detailing how plants in the U. S. automobile industry change output. Weekly data show a variety of margins on which firms'' adjust production. These margins, which are distinct from the usual factor demand choices, differ in their lumpiness, their adjustment costs, and their variable costs. The existence of these margins explains several empirical puzzles of output fluctuations. Using a theory of the short-run dynamic cost function, we are able to infer some of the characteristics of the underlying cost function from the dynamic behavior of the different margins.

AB This paper analyzes the ways in which financially distressed firms try to avoid bankruptcy through public and private debt restructurings, asset sales, mergers, and capital expenditure reductions. Our main finding is that a firm's debt structure affects the way financially distressed firms restructure. The combination of secured private debt and numerous public debt issues seems to impede out-of-court restructurings and increases the probability of a Chapter 11 filing. In addition, we find that, while asset sales are a way of avoiding Chapter 11, they are limited by industry factors: firms in distressed and highly leveraged industries are less prone to sell assets.

Conventional economic analyses have not been successful in explaining international saving differences, so economists have sometimes suggested that national saving differences may be explained by cultural differences.

Using data from the Canadian Survey of Family Expenditures, we find no evidence of cultural effects on saving.

AB The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a new tax subsidy for health insurance purchases by the self-employed. We analyze the changing patterns of insurance demand before and after tax reform to generate new estimates of how the after-tax price of insurance affects the discrete choice of whether to buy insurance. We employ both traditional regression models and difference-in-difference methods that compare changes in insurance coverage across groups around TRA86. The results from our most carefully controlled comparison suggest that a 1 percent increase in the cost of insurance coverage reduces the probability that a self-employed single person will be insured by 1.8 percentage points.

AB Standard models of policy credibility, defined as the expectation that an announced policy will be carried out, emphasize the preferences of the policymaker and the role of tough policies in signaling toughness and raising credibility. Whether a policy is carried out, however, will also reflect the state of the economy- We present a model in which a policymaker maintains a fixed parity in good times, but devalues if the unemployment rate gets too high. Our main conclusion is that if there is persistence in unemployment, observing a tough policy in a given period may lower rather than raise the credibility of a no-devaluation pledge in subsequent periods. We test this implication on EMS interest rates and find support for our hypothesis.

AB A simple static model of North-South trade is developed to examine linkages between national income, pollution, and international trade. Two countries produce a continuum of goods, each differing in pollution intensity. We show that the higher income country chooses stronger environmental protection, and specializes in relatively clean goods. By isolating the scale, composition, and technique effects of international trade on pollution, we show that free trade increases world pollution; an increase in the rich North's production possibilities increases pollution, while similar growth in the poor South lowers pollution; and unilateral transfers from North to South reduce worldwide pollution.

AB We establish conditions which (in various settings) guarantee the existence of equilibria described by ergodic Markov processes with a Borel state space S. Let P(S) denote the probability measures on S, and let s bar arrow pointing right G(s) subset-of P(S) be a (possibly empty-valued) correspondence with closed graph characterizing intertemporal consistency, as prescribed by some particular model. A nonempty measurable set J subset-of S is self-justified if G(s) and P(J) is not empty for all s is-an-element-of J. A time-homogeneous Markov equilibrium (THME) for G is a self-justified set J and a measurable selection PI: J --> P(J) from the restriction of G to J. The paper gives sufficient conditions for existence of compact self-justified sets, and applies the theorem: If G is convex-valued and has a compact self-justified set, then G has an THME with an ergodic measure. The applications are (i) stochastic overlapping generations equilibria, (ii) an extension of the Lucas (1978) asset market equilibrium model to the case of heterogeneous agents, and (iii) equilibria for discounted stochastic games with uncountable state spaces.

ID LEXICOGRAPHIC PROBABILITIES
AB Two of the most important refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept for extensive form games with perfect recall are Selten's (1975) Perfect equilibrium and Kreps and Wilson's (1982) more inclusive sequential equilibrium. These two equilibrium refinements are motivated in very different ways. Nonetheless, as Kreps and Wilson (1982, Section 7) point out, the two concepts lead to similar prescriptions for equilibrium play. For each particular game form, every perfect equilibrium is sequential. Moreover, for almost all assignments of payoffs to outcomes, almost all sequential equilibrium strategy profiles are perfect equilibrium profiles, and all sequential equilibrium outcomes are perfect equilibrium outcomes.
   We establish a stronger result: For almost all assignments of payoffs to outcomes, the sets of sequential and perfect equilibrium strategy profiles are identical. In other words, for almost all games each strategy profile which can be supported by beliefs satisfying the rationality requirement of sequential equilibrium can actually be supported by beliefs satisfying the stronger rationality requirement of perfect equilibrium.
   We obtain this result by exploiting the algebraic/geometric structure of these equilibrium correspondences, following from the fact that they are semi-algebraic sets; i.e., they are defined by finite systems of polynomial inequalities. That the perfect and sequential equilibrium correspondences have this semi-algebraic structure follows from a deep result from mathematical logic, the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem; that this structure has important game-theoretic consequences follows from deep properties of semi-algebraic sets.

AB Suppose that a population of individuals may be grouped according to some vector of characteristics into ''clusters,'' such that each cluster is very ''similar'' in terms of the attributes of its members, but different clusters have members with very ''dissimilar'' attributes. In that case we say that the society is polarized. Our purpose is to study polarization, and to provide a theory of its measurement. Our contention is that polarization, as conceptualized here, is closely related to the generation of social tensions, to the possibilities of revolution and revolt, and to the existence of social unrest in general. We take special care to distinguish our theory from the theory of inequality measurement. We derive measures of polarization that are easily applicable to distributions of characteristics such as income and wealth.

AB The model of general equilibrium with incomplete markets is a generalization of the Arrow-Debreu model which provides a rich framework for studying problems of macroeconomics. This paper shows how the model, which has so far been restricted to economies with a finite horizon, can be extended to the more natural setting of an open-ended future, thereby providing an extension of the finite horizon representative agent models of modem macroeconomics to economies with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets.
   There are two natural concepts of equilibrium over an infinite horizon which prevent agents from entering into Ponzi schemes, that is, from indefinitely postponing the repayment of their debts. The first is based on debt constraints which place bounds on debt at each date-event; the second is based on transversality conditions which limit the asymptotic rate of growth of debt. The concept of an equilibrium with debt constraint is a natural concept of equilibrium for macroeconomic analysis; however the concept of an equilibrium with transversality condition is more amenable to theoretical analysis since it permits the powerful techniques of Arrow-Debreu theory to be carried over to the setting of incomplete markets. In an economy in which agents are impatient (expressed by the Mackey continuity of their preference orderings) and have a degree of impatience at each date-event which is bounded below (a concept defined in the paper), we show that the equilibria of an economy with transversality condition coincide with the equilibria with debt constraints. An equilibrium with transversality condition is shown to exist: it follows that for each economy there is an explicit bound M such that an equilibrium with explicit debt constraint M exists, in which the constraint is never binding-this latter property ensuring that the debt constraint, whose objective is to prevent Ponzi schemes, does not in itself introduce a new imperfection into the model over and above the incompleteness of the markets.

DE SHAPLEY VALUE; DIFFERENTIAL INFORMATION ECONOMIES; COALITIONAL INCENTIVE
   COMPATIBILITY
AB We analyze the Shapley value allocation of an economy with differential information. Since the intent of the Shapley value is to measure the sum of the expected marginal contributions made by an agent to any coalition to which he/she belongs, the value allocation of an economy with differential information provides an interesting way to measure the information advantage of an agent. This feature of the Shapley value allocation is not necessarily shared by the rational expectation equilibrium. Thus, we analyze the informational structure of an economy with differential information from a different and new viewpoint.
   In particular we address the following questions: How do coalitions of agents share their private information? How can one measure the information advantage or superiority of an agent? Is each agent's private information verifiable by other members of a coalition? Do coalitions of agents pool their private information? Do agents have an incentive to report their true private information? What is the correct concept of a value allocation in an economy with differential information? Do value allocations exist in an economy with differential information? We provide answers to each of these questions.

AB The empirical objective of this study is to account for the time-variation in the covariances between stock markets, and to assess the extent of capital market integration. Using data on sixteen national stock markets, we estimate a multivariate factor model in which the volatility of returns is induced by changing volatility in the factors. Unanticipated returns are assumed to depend both on innovations in ''observable'' economic variables and on ''unobservable'' factors. The risk premium on an asset is a linear combination of the risk premia associated with factors.
   We find that idiosyncratic risk is significantly priced, and that the ''price of risk'' is not common across countries. This either can be interpreted as evidence against the null of integrated capital markets or could reflect the failure of some other maintained assumptions. Another empirical finding is that only a small proportion of the covariances between national stock markets and their time-variation can be accounted for by ''observable'' economic variables. Changes in correlations between markets are driven primarily by movements in ''unobservable'' variables.

ID TESTS
AB Rational expectations are frequently justified as the point of convergence of agents' learning process. When agents' learning feeds back on the actual law of motion of the economy convergence of their learning rule to a rational expectations equilibrium (REE) is not guaranteed however. Applying new methods to analyse the convergence of learning in a model of UK stock prices we find evidence that agents could not have learned to form rational expectations if they had attempted to estimate the long-run dynamics of the model. If, however, agents have strong priors and impose a unit root on the model, thus confining their learning to the short run dynamics, there is evidence that recursive learning may eventually lead them to a REE. The learning process on the path to this equilibrium is highly volatile, suggesting that learning may help to explain excess volatility in UK stock prices.

AB The view held by Keynes, that there was a 'speculative appreciation' of sterling prior to its return to the gold standard, has been challenged by Smith and Smith, who argue that expectations of return must have weakened the currency. We demonstrate, first that the positive but decreasing trend displayed in the exchange rate data is consistent with a pattern of autoregressive convergence in fundamentals; and second that this continues to be true when there is a positive 'speculative' element based on expectations of an early return. Hence the key features of the data seem compatible with Keynes's views.

AB We analyse the comparative macroeconomic performance of the Bretton Woods System of pegged exchange rates and the post-Bretton Woods float. The change in volatility of prices and output following the shift to floating does not appear to have been associated with differences in underlying aggregate-supply and aggregate-demand shocks. Rather, under fixed rates, monetary policy had to be adjusted to stabilise the exchange rate, flattening the demand curve and thereby increasing the output response and reducing the price response to aggregate supply shocks. Following the shift to floating, monetary policy was freed, steepening the demand curve and increasing price volatility relative to output volatility.

The sensitivity of the teacher choice to relative wage changes is examined and compared for men and women separately. The paper presents a counterfactual prediction of the decisions which each cohort would have made had they experienced the market conditions of the other and estimates a decomposition of the changes in the average probabilities due to remunerative and other factors.

AB Contrary to popular belief, the linear quadratic inventory model does not imply that, in response to demand shocks, output is always less variable than sales. When demand shocks are not anticipated, and without this assumption it is hard to see why firms should hold inventories in the first place, it is shown that output can be more variable than sales, even when the only shocks are demand shocks, and the inventory target is not a rising function of sales. The variance of output will typically exceed that of sales when the firm's marginal cost curve is fairly flat.

As a result, there is little agreement about the extent to which ODA is allocated according to the needs of the recipient countries. The purpose of this paper is to develop a rigorous theoretical model of ODA allocation that can be used to provide consistent estimates of the importance of recipient needs.

One particular study (Coulter, Cowell and Jenkins (1992)) has found that equivalence scales used in the UK official statistics 'provide lower estimates of the extent of inequality and poverty than do other scales'. In this paper we demonstrate that these kind of results are dependent on the particular year of data and equivalence scale specification that is used and are not properties intrinsic to particular methodologies. Results are also not robust to the use of more recent UK microeconomic data.

(1992) drawing on a more general discussion of parametric equivalence scale and scale relativity issues and new empirical results. We show that criticisms of our earlier work are unfounded. When the McClements scale is properly characterised, the scale does indeed provide lower estimates of poverty and inequality levels than most other scales. We reiterate our conclusion that relationships between scale relativities and inequality and poverty indices may be index-specific. Moreover the picture about distributional trends may differ from that about levels.

The job destruction process is shown to have more volatile dynamics than the job creation process.

This assumption (''ranking'') is contrasted with the assumption of random hiring (''no-ranking''). By embodying this assumption in a model of the labour market with job creation/destruction an matching, the joint behaviour of unemployment, the distribution of unemployment durations, and wages are characterized. The implication that the re-employment prospects of employed workers, were they to become unemployed, are better than those of the currently unemployed appears to have been an important feature of European unemployment experience in the 1980's.

TI CROSS-SECTIONAL EFFICIENCY AND LABOR HOARDING IN A MATCHING MODEL OF
   UNEMPLOYMENT
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SEARCH; EQUILIBRIUM; EMPLOYMENT
AB We study positive and normative aspects of steady-state equilibrium in a market where firms of endogenous size experience idiosyncratic shocks and undergo a costly search process to hire their workers. The stylized model we propose highlights interactions between job-security provisions and sectoral shocks in determining the natural rate of unemployment, the allocation of labour, and the extent of labour hoarding, and rationalizes cross-sectional asymmetries of gross employment flows at the firm level. In our model, where productivity and search costs are dynamically heterogeneous across firms, decentralized wage bargains imply important cross-sectional inefficiencies, which overshadow the static search inefficiencies on which simpler models focus.

AB This paper introduces on-the-job search into the model of search equilibrium that builds on the concept of the matching function and non-cooperative wage behaviour. On-the-job search takes place only at short job tenures because of the accumulation of job-specific human capital. The model of search equilibrium retains its familiar structure but yields new results. The most interesting one is a fall in the responsiveness of unemployment to productivity shocks because of induced changes in the composition of jobs and the number of employed job seekers.

TI GROWTH AND UNEMPLOYMENT
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyses the effects of growth on long-run unemployment using a search model of equilibrium unemployment where growth arises explicitly from the introduction of new technologies that require labour reallocation for their implementation.
   The analysis uncovers and compares between two competing effects of growth on unemployment. The first is a capitalisation effect, whereby an increase in growth raises the capitalised returns from creating jobs and consequently reduces the equilibrium rate of unemployment. The second is a creative destruction effect whereby an increase in growth reduces the duration of a job match, thereby raising the equilibrium level of unemployment both directly, by raising the job separation rate, and indirectly, by discouraging the creation of job vacancies.

ID INFORMATION; CONSUMPTION; ECONOMY
AB Credit contracts play a direct role in pooling risk between households in northern Nigeria. Repayments owed by borrowers depend on realizations of random shocks by both borrowers and lenders. The paper develops two models of state-contingent loans. The first is a competitive equilibrium in perfectly enforceable contracts. The second permits imperfect information and equilibrium default. Estimates of both models indicate that quantitatively important state-contingent payments are embedded in these loan transactions, but that a fully efficient risk-pooling equilibrium is not achieved. The research is based on a year-long survey in Zaria, Nigeria conducted by the author.

AB This paper studies incentives and loss of control in a hierarchy model which combines and generalizes the models of Williamson, Calvo-Wellisz and Keren-Levhari. In our model of the hierarchy, the levels of effort from managers and workers, the wage scales, the span of control and, in particular, the total number of tiers are all endogenous. Using optimal control techniques, we show that in the optimal hierarchy the wage scales and effort levels decrease as one moves down the hierarchy. As the hierarchy expands with no technological progress, workers exert less effort and are paid less, top managers work harder and are paid more and the wage distribution becomes increasingly skewed.

AB An experiment was conducted to test whether discounted repeated play leads to greater cooperation and coordination than one-shot play in a public good environment with incomplete information. The experiment was designed so that, theoretically, repeated play can sustain equilibria with substantially higher group earnings than result in the one-shot Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The design varied a number of environmental parameters, including the size of the group, and the statistical distribution of marginal rates of substitution between the public and private good. Marginal rates of substitution were private information but the statistical distribution was common knowledge. The results indicate that repetition leads to greater cooperation, and that the magnitude of these gains depends systematically both on the ability of players to monitor each other's strategy and on the environmental parameters.

Despite the informational restrictions cooperation is still a sequential equilibrium supported by ''contagious'' punishments. The equilibrium does not require excessive patience, and contrary to previous thought, need not be extraordinarily fragile. It is robust to the introduction of small amounts of noise and remains nearly efficient. Extensions are discussed to models with heterogeneous rates of time preference and without public randomizations.

TI ONCE-OFF AND CONTINUING GAINS FROM TRADE
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Most economists are familiar with the static or ''once-off'' welfare gains created by opening an economy to trade. Much less is known about how the resource reallocations necessitated by this move affect long-run growth, and hence whether they provide dynamic or continuing welfare gains in future periods. This paper employs a dynamic Ricardian trade model to provide a decomposition of the gains from trade into ''once-off'' and continuing categories. In one version of the model, trade is always welfare enhancing; in the other, ''once-off'' losses may occur alongside dynamic pins. In both versions the magnitude of ''once-off'' and continuing effects are related to absolute and relative country size, similarity in production structures, rates of time preference, and the productivity of R&D.

AB To test a model of rational addiction, we examine whether lower past and future prices for cigarettes raise current cigarette consumption. The empirical results tend to support the implication of addictive behavior that cross price effects are negative and that long-run responses exceed short-run responses. Since the long-run price elasticity of demand is almost twice as large as the short-run price elasticity, the long-run increase in tax revenue from an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes is considerably smaller than the short-run increase.

AB We consider an individual who lacks the information-processing capacity required for a direct comparison of all feasible allocations. Instead of finding at once a best allocation, the individual myopically adjusts his current allocation toward higher utility. The individual makes adjustment errors inversely proportional to his ability to choose. We compare the stationary state of this process with the standard model. We see how an imperfect ability to choose modifies both positive and normative predictions of the standard model and how the standard model can be obtained from our more general one as the special case corresponding to perfect ability.

Its main advantages over the traditional approach based on signing derivatives are that (i) it utilizes only a subset of the assumptions, resulting in a simpler theory that facilitates focusing attention on the economics rather than the mathematics, (ii) it applies to discrete changes, even when there are multiple equilibria and when some equilibria do not vary smoothly with the parameters, and (iii) it incorporates a formal theory of the robustness of conclusions to assumptions, which helps modelers distinguish which assumptions are ''critical'' to their comparative-statics conclusions.

AB This paper entertains the hypothesis that human time preferences are in evolutionary equilibrium (i.e. that no mutation changing time preferences could be favored by natural selection). This hypothesis implies that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) holding Darwinian fitness constant must equal the MRS holding utility constant. Furthermore, in a market economy the latter must equal the MRS in exchange. Exploiting these principles, I find that the long-term real interest rate should equal ln(2) per generation (about 2 percent per year) and that young adults should discount the future more rapidly than their elders.

Using this model, we show that ostensibly uninformative advertising plays a key role in bringing about coordination economies, by directing consumer search toward firms that offer the best deals. Optimal consumer search takes the form of a simple rule of thumb that uses observed advertising information to guide search. Both industry concentration and social surplus are higher in the presence of advertising, relative to a no-advertising benchmark.

AB Information about various policy alternatives is dispersed among the individual members of a society. Prior to a vote over the alternatives, some people take costly political action to signal their private information to voters. By informing voting decisions, political action has potential to decrease the likelihood that voters cast ''mistaken'' votes. Perhaps surprisingly, pre-election communication may be counterproductive. The dispersed information is partially aggregated by the vote, and political action may contribute ''noise'' to the voting process. In some cases, the voting mechanism is more likely to implement the full-information voting outcome in the absence of pre-election political action.

When this rate of erosion i.5 high, cycling of ethics and economic activity emerges. Otherwise, ethics and economic activity converge to a stable long-run limiting value.

ID FLUCTUATIONS; BEHAVIOR; CASCADES; DEMAND; MONEY
AB We present a three-stage model of market dynamics. In the first stage, routine behavior tends to keep information of common interest trapped in private hands. In the second stage, private information reaches a threshold that triggers some agents to alter their behavior; these actions release information to the market. The final stage involves the market's response to this news as other participants react to the initial departure from routine behavior. We present an application to industry investment. We also outline applications to the international debt crisis, to hank runs, and to political upheavals.

AB This paper characterizes equilibrium exclusionary contracts between buyers, an incumbent firm, and a potential entrant when buyers can either vertically integrate or contract with the outside entrant. In this setting, exclusionary contracts are generally shown to be efficient and to deter inefficient entry that would otherwise occur. With multiple unorganized buyers, equilibrium contracts are shown to take a ''divide-and-conquer'' form and, in some cases, to deter some efficient entry. In such cases, efficient contracting can be restored by a policy that prohibits price discrimination and gives agents free reign to sign exclusionary agreements.

ID RISK AVERSE BUYERS; COMPETITION; BIDDERS; DESIGN; NUMBER; COSTS
AB We model entry incentives in auctions with risk-neutral bidders and characterize a symmetric equilibrium in which the number of entrants is stochastic.  The presence of too many potential bidders raises coordination costs that detract from welfare.  We show that the seller and society can benefit from policies that reduce market thickness (i.e., the relative abundance of buyers).  Our analysis extends well-known revenue-equivalence and ranking theorems but also demonstrates that variations in the auction environment affect optimal policies (e.g., reservation prices) in ways not anticipated by models that ignore entry.

ID LONG-RUN GROWTH; INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; INCREASING RETURNS;

AB Is inequality harmful for growth? We suggest that it is. In a society where distributional conflict is important, political decisions produce economic policies that tax investment and growth-promoting activities in order to redistribute income. The paper formulates a theoretical model that captures this idea. The model's implications are supported by the evidence. Both historical panel data and postwar cross sections indicate a significant and large negative relation between inequality and growth. This relation is only present in democracies.

ID HEALTH-INSURANCE
AB I consider the labor-market effects of mandates which raise the costs of employing a demographically identifiable group. The efficiency of these policies will be largely dependent on the extent to which their costs are shifted to group-specific wages. I study several state and federal mandates which stipulated that childbirth be covered comprehensively in health insurance plans, raising the relative cost of insuring women of childbearing age. I find substantial shifting of the costs of these mandates to the wages of the targeted group. Correspondingly, I find little effect on total labor input for that group.

ID PERMANENT INCOME; PANEL DATA; CONSUMPTION; LIQUIDITY; GOODS;

AB This paper tests an optimal (S, s) rule in household durable purchases and examines directly the resulting aggregate expenditure dynamics. The observed decision rule responds to income uncertainty and growth as predicted by an (S, s) model resulting from transactions costs. Tests against liquidity constraints find that about half the households purchase according to an optimal (S, s) rule. Aggregating the (S, s) rule over households produces a cross-section distribution of durables holdings. The empirical distribution is similar to that predicted theoretically, as is its response to aggregate shocks. Furthermore, simulations of aggregate expenditure based on the household distribution exhibit dynamics consistent with those observed in the 1980s.

ID PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS; EARNINGS INEQUALITY; UNITED-STATES;
   INFORMATION; CONSUMPTION; EQUILIBRIUM; AGGREGATION; GROWTH; TRENDS
AB The permanent income hypothesis implies that, for any cohort of people born at the same time, inequality in both consumption and income should grow with age. We investigate this prediction using cohort data constructed from 11 years of household survey data from the United States, 22 years from Great Britain, and 14 years from Taiwan. The data show that within-cohort consumption and income inequality measures do indeed increase with age in the three economies and that the rate of increase is similar in all three. According to the permanent income hypothesis, the increase in inequality reflects cumulative differences in the effects of luck on consumption. Other models of intertemporal choice-such as those with strong precautionary motives or liquidity constraints-can limit or even prevent the spread of inequality, as can insurance arrangements that share risk across individuals. The evidence on the spread of inequality can therefore be used to help quantify the extent to which private and social arrangements moderate the impact of risk on the distribution of individual welfare.

ID SUPPLY RESPONSE; INVESTMENT; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; PRICES; MODEL
AB U.S. beef cattle stocks are among the most periodic economic time series. A theory of cattle cycles is constructed on the basis of breeding stock inventory decisions. The low fertility rate of cows and substantial lags and future feedback between fertility and consumption decisions cause the demographic structure of the herd to respond cyclically to exogenous shocks in demand and production costs. Known demographic parameters of cattle imply sharp numerical benchmarks for the resulting dynamic system and closely compare with independent econometric time-series estimates over the 1875-1990 period. The model fits extremely well.

AB Trade is both uncertain and sequential. Money surprises are not neutral because prices at the beginning of the trading process cannot depend on its end. In contrast with fixed-price models, in this paper sellers can change prices during trade. In contrast with Lucas's article, here there is no asymmetry in the information about the money supply. The price quoted by individual sellers may adjust slowly to changes in the targeted money supply, but the distribution of quoted prices adjusts perfectly to these changes and the real price distribution is independent of the anticipated rate of change in the money supply.

AB This paper studies top executive turnover and compensation, and their relation to firm performance in the largest Japanese and U.S. companies. Japanese executive turnover and compensation are related to earnings, stock returns, and, to a lesser extent, sales performance measures. The fortunes of Japanese top executives, therefore, are positively correlated with stock performance and current cash flows (or with factors contributing to such performance). The relations for the Japanese executives are generally economically and statistically similar to those for their U.S. counterparts. There is some evidence, however, that the fortunes of Japanese executives are more sensitive to low income but less sensitive to stock returns than those of U.S. executives.

Specifically, the calculated redirection of consumption priorities by those reduced to subsistence income levels is embodied in the utility function, and the biological necessity of consuming sufficient nutrition to support health is modeled as a subsistence constraint. This methodology is then applied to the potato culture that existed in Ireland prior to the 1845-48 famine. It is suggested that the evolution of this culture was shaped by subsistence-driven behavior similar to the behavior that underlies the Giffen effect.

AB This paper describes a contract theory of public finance of college education that explains why everyone pays for the college education of a lucky minority. The contract provides gambles that families desire. Optimizing the contract determines the taxes paid by all members of society, fees paid by those whose children go to college, the fraction of children who are admitted to college, and the quality of college education. Changes in wealth lead to changes in taxes and admissions, but fees and quality are invariant. The practice of using a cutoff level of precollege achievement to determine admission to college is justified by the theory.

We add self-reporting to the model of the control of harmful externalities through probabilistic law enforcement, and we characterize the optimal scheme. Self-reporting offers two advantages over schemes without self-reporting: enforcement resources are saved because individuals who report their harmful acts need not be detected, and risk is reduced because individuals who report their behavior bear certain rather than uncertain sanctions.

AB The new economics of regulation is an application of the principal-agent methodology to the contractual relationship between regulators and regulated firms. After a critique of the traditional paradigms of regulation from the point of view of information economics a canonical model of regulation under asymmetric information is developed. A survey of the main results obtained in the new economics of regulation is then provided, in particular concerning the implementation of optimal contracts by a menu of linear contracts, the dichotomy between pricing and cost reimbursement rules, the auctioning of incentive contracts, the dynamics of contracting under limited commitment, and the hierarchical problems in regulation. Empirical implications are then discussed and avenues of further research are described in the conclusion.

AB The full insurance model is tested using data from three poor, high risk villages in the semi-arid tropics of southern India. The model presented here incorporates a number of salient features of the actual village economies. Although the model is rejected statistically, it does provide a surprisingly good benchmark. Household consumptions comove with village average consumption. More clearly, household consumptions are not much influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e. for village level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages.

AB This paper explores the distinction between nonatomicity and thick markets as the source of perfect competition. The focus of the paper is the construction of a model of an imperfectly competitive economy with a nonatomic continuum of traders and a continuum of differentiated commodities, for which Walrasian equilibria exist. The failure of perfect competition in this instance can be identified in two ways: individuals can affect prices and the core is strictly larger than the set of Walrasian allocations. By contrast, it is shown that, when markets are physically or economically thick (or both), then individuals cannot typically affect prices and the core always coincides with the set of Walrasian allocations.

AB The computation of large-scale nonlinear intertemporal optimization problems requires time-aggregation assumptions. This consists in choosing a specific gridding of the time horizon, and considering the optimal solution computed using this restricted set of dates as an approximation to the underlying continuous- or more disaggregated discrete-time formulation. A procedure generally adopted for time aggregation in applied intertemporal optimization economic models using mathematical programming techniques is shown to be inappropriate, as it introduces a dependency of the solution steady state to a specific choice of sequence of time intervals. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions to avoid this dependency, i.e., to ensure that the discretization satisfies steady-state invariance. The result is a considerable improvement in the numerical accuracy of the time-aggregated approximation. These easy-to-handle conditions are shown to apply to a broad class of models such as multidimensional intertemporal problems and endogenous growth models and may therefore prove extremely powerful in applied works such as large-scale applied general-equilibrium modeling. This conclusion is further highlighted by a comparison between this approach and a spectral-projection method using optimal orthogonal collocation as recently introduced by Judd (1992).

AB The paper considers the OLS, the IV, and two method-of-moments estimators, MM and MMK, of the coefficients of a single equation, where the explanatory variables are correlated with the disturbance term. The MM and MMK estimators are generalizations of the LIML and LIMLK estimators, respectively.
   Multivariate first-order approximations to the distributions are derived under normality, using a parameter sequence where the number of instruments increases as the number of observations increases. Numerical results show these approximations are more accurate, compared to large-sample approximations, even if the number of instruments is small.
   The moments of the multivariate limit distributions of the MM and MMK estimators can be consistently estimated under a variety of parameter sequences, including the large-sample sequence. The new approximate confidence regions perform well in terms of exact levels, compared to traditional ones.
   The IV estimator of the coefficient of a single explanatory endogenous variable is interpreted as a shrinkage estimator, which is dominated, in practical cases, by the MM and MMK estimators in terms of nearness to the true value in the sense of Pitman.

AB Long-run analysis is often based on perfect foresight equilibrium relationships arbitrarily augmented to incorporate stochastic shocks. This paper examines whether perfect foresight models admit interpretations as limits of stochastic economies and reflect long-run behaviour and policy effects. It provides a novel interpretation of such models, specifies consistency criteria for long-run analysis, and proposes metrics for model convergence. Analytical and calibration exercises are conducted to show that convergence to perfect foresight need not occur, and even when it occurs, it does not ensure that relationships between long-run averages or low-frequency components are captured by perfect foresight models.

AB The concept of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium is central to noncooperative game theory and the latter's use in microeconomic theory. This paper considers the creation of this theoretical construct, examining the separate contributions of both Cournot and Nash, and showing how the two were ultimately joined together in the eyes of contemporary economic theorists. Rather than simply show how Cournot served as a precursor to Nash, we challenge the traditional approach, and emphasise the shifts in interpretation of their respective contributions. In so doing, we address some pertinent questions about the manner in which economic theorists view the evolution of their own discipline.

AB We seek to establish the general empirical importance of investment-motivated saving. Our hypothesis is that inadequate financial intermediation will induce agents to save more in order to undertake lumpy physical investment in the future. The result is a positive relationship between the degree of capital market imperfection and the size of the private saving rate. A simulation exercise calibrated on Taiwan found a close match between the simulated and actual data. Regression analysis established that the private saving rate was negatively related to the level of financial market sophistication.

AB It is widely believed that the integration of European economies will have little impact on labor mobility. This does not mean, however, that European labour markets will be unaffected by the process of economic integration. In this paper we show that, with increased competition resulting from closer economic integration, the hump-shaped pattern summarising the relationship between economic performance and the degree of centralisation in wage bargaining (Calmfors and Driffill, I988) flatterns out. As a consequence, the importance of where a particular economy stands on the wage bargaining scale diminishes.

Rent sharing due to efficiency wages is shown to create a unique downstream vertical spillover while rent sharing due to wage bargaining creates a two-way vertical spillover. Using U.K. firm level panel data, we show that downstream spillovers due to efficiency wage payments and union activity exist, and constitute general direct evidence of efficiency wage payments in U.K. companies.

TI AN INVESTMENT MODEL FOR THE SUPPLY OF TRAINING BY EMPLOYERS
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

DT Article
ID LABOR
AB This paper explores the incentives faced by employers for supplying general training of the type given to craft apprentices. An investment model is developed, in which the employer's return takes the form of reduced recruitment costs for skilled labour. An empirical model is derived, and fitted to apprentice recruitment data for the British engineering industry, 1966-88. The model succeeds in predicting the collapse of apprentice training in the 1980s; important explanatory variables are the real interest rate, and an index of skill shortages.

ID INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT; MARKET; COOPERATION; HARASSMENT; MODELS
AB The exercise of insider power is frequently considered as a major cause of involuntary unemployment. We show that under standard assumptions - insiders are selfish and they need not fear the loss of their job - insider power does not cause unemployment but leads to the introduction of a market clearing two-tier wage system.
   Yet, while insider power is a common phenomenon two-tier systems are rarely observed. To explain this fact we introduce interdependent preferences. We show that if entrants exhibit a preference for fairness the presence of insider power gives rise to an efficiency wage effect which may prevent the introduction of market clearing two-tier systems.

We show that the alternative method of financier remuneration (i.e. mudarabah profit-and-loss sharing) will, under certain conditions, enhance capital investment on account of its ability to act as an efficient revelation device. By applying ideas developed in the western contract literature, we show that a mudarabah contract between the manager of a project and a syndicate of investors may permit a more efficient revelation of any informational asymmetries between the two.

AB Recent articles have attempted to restore the use of a simple measure of the money supply as an indicator of future price levels, P*, and to re-establish a causal link from money to prices. In this paper we argue that the P* approach is flawed. It is certainly more complex than traditional monetarist approaches but the fundamental questions of causality are in no way either affected or resolved. We argue that the P* relationship does not have a causal link with prices but rather the causality runs from prices to money. We also find that there is some causality running from money to real income, so that monetary conditions do seem to have some predictive power for future levels of activity.

AB We analyze the response of small versus large manufacturing firms to monetary policy. The goal is to obtain evidence on the importance of financial propagation mechanisms for aggregate activity. We find that small firms account for a significantly disproportionate share of the manufacturing decline that follows tightening of monetary policy. They play a surprisingly prominent role in the slowdown of inventory demand. Large firms initially borrow to accumulate inventories. After a brief period, small firms quickly shed inventories. We attempt to sort financial from nonfinancial explanations with evidence on asymmetries and on balance sheet effects on inventory demand across size classes.

TI LIVING BY THE GOLDEN-RULE - MULTIMARKET CONTACT IN THE UNITED-STATES
   AIRLINE INDUSTRY
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID MARKET POWER
AB This paper examines empirically the effects of multimarket contact on pricing in the U. S. airline industry. The analysis of the time-series and cross-sectional variability of airline fares in the 1000 largest domestic city-pair routes reveals the presence of statistically significant and quantitatively important multimarket effects-fares are higher in city-pair markets served by carriers with extensive interroute contacts. These findings are consistent with the claims of industry experts that airlines live by the ''golden rule''; i.e., that they refrain from initiating aggressive pricing actions in a given route for fear of what their competitors might do in other jointly contested routes.
   During his testimony, Mr. Steven B. Elkins (Senior Director of marketing systems development for Northwest Airlines) cited an example in which Northwest lowered fares on night flights that were flying with empty seats in a number of routes from Minneapolis and Upper Midwest cities to various West Coast cities.  He said that Continental Airlines swiftly responded by cutting prices in important Northwest markets... Mr. Elkins's memo advises Northwest pricing analysts: ''We Will Live by the Golden Rule!'' In his testimony, he explained that, ''the Golden Rule in that context was that I did not want my pricing analyst initiating actions in another carrier's market like Chicago for fear of what that other carrier might do to retaliate'' [Wall Street Journal, October 9, 1990, p. B1].

ID WAGES
AB This paper investigates the shift in demand away from unskilled and toward skilled labor in U. S. manufacturing over the 1980s. Production labor-saving technological change is the chief explanation for this shift. That conclusion is based on three facts: (1) the shift is due mostly to increased use of skilled workers within the 450 industries in U. S. manufacturing rather than to a reallocation of employment between industries, as would be implied by a shift in product demand due to trade or to a defense buildup; (2) trade- and defense-demand are associated with only small employment reallocation effects; (3) increased use of nonproduction workers is strongly correlated with investment in computers and in R&D.

AB In a rational profit-maximizing world, banks should maintain a credit policy of lending if and only if borrowers have positive net present value projects. Why then are changes in credit policy seemingly correlated with changes in the condition of those demanding credit? This paper argues that rational bank managers with short horizons will set credit policies that influence and are influenced by other banks and demand side conditions. This leads to a theory of low frequency business cycles driven by bank credit policies. Evidence from the banking crisis in New England in the early 1990s is consistent with the assumptions and predictions of the theory.

AB The motivating intuition is that the presence of nonmaximizing agents induces maximizing agents to take advantage of them, and that this might magnify the effect of small deviations from maximizing behavior. This intuition is explored using a simple dynamic model. With an inflexible entry process, small deviations from maximizing behavior may have a substantial impact on the allocation of gains from trade. With a flexible entry process, the effect is dampened by adjustments in entry. Yet these deviations result in a first-order efficiency loss, in contrast to the second-order loss that one would expect from looking at standard static models.

Policies that maximize growth are optimal only for a government that cares solely about pure ''capitalists.'' The greater the inequality of wealth and income, the higher the rate of taxation, and the lower growth. We present empirical results that show that inequality in land and income ownership is negatively correlated with subsequent economic growth.

Mishkin shows that the spread between the twelve-month and three-month interest rates helps predict the difference between twelve-month and three-month inflation. We apply a simple existing framework, which lets the real interest rate vary in the short run but converge to a constant in the long run, to this problem. The appropriate indicator of expected inflation uses the entire length of the yield curve, estimating the steepness of a specific nonlinear transformation, rather than being restricted to a spread between two points. The resulting indicator better predicts inflation, over 1960-1991.

AB With asymmetric information, full commitment to long-term contracts may permit markets to approach first-best allocations. However, commitment can be undermined by opportunistic behavior, notably renegotiation. We reexamine commitment in insurance markets. We present an alternative model (which extends Laffont and Tirole's procurement model to address uncertainty and competition), which involves semipoolig in the first period followed by separation. This and competing models (e.g., single-period models and no-commitment models) have different predictions concerning temporal patterns of insurer profitability. A test using California data suggests that some automobile insurers use commitment to attract selective portfolios comprising disproportionate numbers of low risks.

Using contractual data from a representative insurer, we estimate a reduced-form hedonic premium equation and the inverse of the marginal bid equation for insurance coverage. The data reveal an equilibrium with adverse selection and market signaling but lead us to reject the hypothesis that high risks receive contracts subsidized by low risks.

AB This paper calculates numerical solutions to the principal-agent problem and compares the results to the stylized facts of CEO compensation. The numerical predictions come from parameterizing the models of Grossman and Hart and of Holmstrom and Milgrom. While the correct incentives for a CEO can greatly enhance a firm's performance, providing such incentives need not be expensive. For many parameter values, CEO compensation need increase only by about $10 for every $1,000 of additional shareholder value; for some values, the amount is 0.003 cents.

AB Tax-supported churches were established in most American colonies. Public Congregationalist churches in New England were not privatized until the early nineteenth century. After privatization, demand for preachers rose rapidly. There is weaker evidence that church membership also rose quickly. The increase in preachers came almost totally from private denominations. The privatization of religion was further accompanied by a change in methods of finance.

AB We propose a theory of economic development in which technology adoption and barriers to such adoptions are the focus. The size of these barriers differs across countries and time. The larger these barriers, the greater the investment a firm must make to adopt a more advanced technology. The model is calibrated to the U.S. balanced growth observations and the postwar Japanese development miracle. For this calibrated structure we find that the disparity in technology adoption barriers needed to account for the huge observed income disparity across countries is not implausibly large.

AB The late nineteenth century saw international mass migrations of capital and labor from the Old World to the New. Factors chased each other and the abundant resources at the frontier. Demographic structure also contributed to the massive capital flows from Britain to the New World. The dependency hypothesis is confirmed by estimation of savings functions in three New World economies (Argentina, Australia, and Canada) in which high dependency rates may have significantly depressed domestic savings rates and pulled in foreign investment: in effect an intergenerational transfer from old savers in the Old World to young savers in the New.

ID COMPARATIVE STATICS; CONSTRAINTS; ALLOCATION; NUTRITION; TIME
AB Productive consumption adds to utility and income at the same time. The shadow price of a productive good is equal to its money price less its marginal product. As more of the good is consumed, its shadow price rises because of diminishing productivity, and the consumer's full income also rises because the marginal product is positive. This paper uses a simple method to derive the comparative statics of the demand system when shadow prices and full income are endogenous. The direction of the overall bias induced by endogenous prices and income is found to be determinate. We demonstrate that the demand for productive goods tends to be relatively unresponsive to exogenous changes in prices and income. We also show that labor supply will be relatively unresponsive to wage and unearned income if market work causes fatigue.

We characterize the empirical implications of this approach for dynamic investment models and test these implications using firm-level data. The model we estimate is based on the Euler equation for optimal capital accumulation in the presence of convex adjustment costs. The theoretical model explicitly allows for debt finance and financial assets. The empirical investigation uses U.K. company panel data to estimate dynamic investment models using GMM and tests the derived implications.

This paper proposes and solves a model of sequential irreversible investment and characterizes the aggregate implications of microeconomic irreversibility and idiosyncratic uncertainty. If a large amount of idiosyncratic uncertainty is allowed for, the distributional dynamics induced by the nonlinear character of irreversible investment policies are capable of smoothing the dynamics of aggregate investment (relative to those of its forcing processes) to the extent required by U.S. data.

AB Changes in variance, or volatility, over time can be modelled using the approach based on autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH). However, the generalizations to multivariate series can be difficult to estimate and interpret. Another approach is to model variance as an unobserved stochastic process. Although it is not easy to obtain the exact likelihood function for such stochastic variance models, they tie in closely with developments in finance theory and have certain statistical attractions. This article sets up a multivariate model, discusses its statistical treatment and shows how it can be modified to capture common movements in volatility in a very natural way. The model is then fitted to daily observations on exchange rates.

AB This paper analyses a new estimator for the structural parameters of dynamic models of discrete choice. Based on an inversion theorem due to Hotz and Miller (1993), which establishes the existence of a one-to-one mapping between the conditional valuation functions for the dynamic problem and their associated conditional choice probabilities, we exploit simulation techniques to estimate models which do not possess terminal states. In this way our Conditional Choice Simulation (CCS) estimator complements the Conditional Choice Probability (CCP) estimator of Hotz and Miller (1993). Drawing on work in empirical process theory by Pakes and Pollard (1989), we establish its large sample properties, and then conduct a Monte Carlo study of Rust's (1987) model of bus engine replacement to compare its small sample properties with those of Maximum Likelihood (ML).

ID INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY; IMPLEMENTATION; ALLOCATION; PROVISION
AB Under the ''Conservative Equal costs'' mechanism to produce a non-excludable (one-dimensional) public good, each agent reports his demand. The lowest reported demand of public good is produced and its cost is shared equally among all agents. When the cost of producing the public good is convex, this mechanism is strategy-proof (even with respect to coalitions), anonymous and induces voluntary participation. No other mechanism shares these three properties.
   When the public good is excludable (its cost still convex), there is a mechanism with the same properties, that everyone prefers to conservative equal costs. This mechanism excludes the agent with the lowest (equal costs) demand from consuming (or paying for) a larger amount of the good, ameliorating the free-rider problem.

ID REDUCED FORM AUCTIONS; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION;
   PRIVATE INFORMATION; INCENTIVES; ALLOCATION
AB This paper characterizes interim efficient mechanisms for public good production and cost allocation in a two-type environment with risk-neutral, quasi-linear preferences and fixed-size projects, where the distribution of the private good, as well as the public goods decision, affects social welfare. An efficient public good decision can always be accomplished by a majority voting scheme, where the number of ''YES'' votes required depends on the welfare weights in a simple way. The results are shown to have a natural geometry and an intuitive interpretation. We also extend these results to allow for restrictions on feasible transfer rules, ranging from the traditional unlimited transfers to the extreme case of no transfers.
   For a range of welfare weights, an optimal scheme is a two-stage procedure which combines a voting stage with a second stage where an even-chance lottery is used to determine who pays. We call this the ''lottery draft mechanism''. Since such a cost-sharing scheme does not require transfers, it follows that in many cases transfers are not necessary to achieve the optimal allocation. For other ranges of welfare weights the second stage is more complicated, but the voting stage remains the same. If transfers are completely infeasible, randomized voting rules may be optimal. The paper also provides a geometric characterization of the effects of voluntary participation constraints.

ID STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR; EQUILIBRIUM
AB Without assuming rational expectations, we examine the implications of a stationarity assumption in a standard bargaining model with one-sided incomplete information, where the seller makes an offer in each period. Instead of computing a weakly stationary equilibrium, we invoke rationalizability (Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984)) combined with the restriction that the buyer's acceptance rule be weakly stationary. There exists a pair of rationalizable sets of pure strategies for the seller and the buyer which are weakly stationary. We demonstrate that any initial offer from the seller induced by a strategy rationalized by a weakly stationary acceptance rule for the buyer must entail the Coase property. Our result does not presume the selection of a particular equilibrium and follows directly from the weak stationarity assumption of the buyer's acceptance rule and the rational behaviour of the players.

Employers in an external spot labour market attempt to infer worker quality from the observable actions taken by the firm (such as the number of workers it lays off). The threat of spot market raids distorts the optimal contract. Layoffs may be involuntary and can exceed efficient levels. A seniority layoff rule may be included in the contract to avoid the adverse selection problems that arise if layoffs are conducted on the basis of ability.

AB Average postwar expansions are twice as long as prewar expansions, and contractions are one-half as long. This paper investigates three possible explanations. The first explanation is that shocks to the economy have been smaller in the postwar period The second explanation is that the composition of output has shifted from very cyclical sectors to less cyclical sectors. The third explanation is that the apparent stabilization is largely spurious and is caused by differences in the way that prewar and postwar business-cycle reference dates were chosen by the NBER. The evidence presented in this paper favors this third explanation.

TI MONEY AND GROWTH - AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID REAL BUSINESS-CYCLE; FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; MODERATE INFLATIONS;
   WELFARE COSTS; POLICY; MODEL; ECONOMY
AB This paper takes an alternative approach to the topic of money and growth by developing a model in which the effects of sustained capital accumulation on an evolving system of payments, in addition to the conventional effects of sustained inflation on growth, are examined. While the effects of inflation on growth are small, the effects of growth on the monetary system are substantial. The results are consistent with ideas about money and growth contained in work that predates that of Tobin and Sidrauski, as well as with evidence that money and asset demands vary systematically within economies as they develop.

ID POSTWAR ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INDEX NUMBERS; OUTPUT; INPUT
AB This paper analyzes productivity growth in 17 OECD countries over the period 1979-1988. A nonparametric programming method (activity analysis) is used to compute Malmquist productivity indexes. These are decomposed into two component measures, namely, technical change and efficiency change. We find that U.S. productivity growth is slightly higher than average, all of which is due to technical change. Japan's productivity growth is the highest in the sample, with almost half due to efficiency change.

AB We provide a theoretical interpretation of two features of international data: the countercyclical movements in net exports and the tendency for the trade balance to be negatively correlated with current and future movements in the terms of trade, but positively correlated with past movements. We document the same properties in a two-country stochastic growth model in which trade fluctuations reflect, in large part, the dynamics of capital formation. We find that our general-equilibrium perspective is essential: the relation between the trade balance and the terms of trade depends critically on the source of fluctuations.

ID SEARCH EQUILIBRIUM; MONEY; ECONOMY
AB We develop a model of production and exchange with uncertainty concerning the quality of commodities and study the role of fiat money in ameliorating frictions caused by private information. The model is specified so that, without private information, only high-quality commodities are produced, and there is no welfare gain from using money. With private information, there can be equilibria (and sometimes multiple equilibria) where low-quality commodities are produced, and money can increase welfare. Money works by promoting useful production and exchange. In efficient monetary equilibria, agents adopt strategies that increase the probability of acquiring high-quality output.

TI UNEMPLOYMENT AND VACANCIES WITH SECTORAL SHIFTS
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; SEARCH; EQUILIBRIUM; DISTURBANCES; REALLOCATION
AB Recent analyses of unemployment - vacancy series suggest that aggregate shocks, rather than sectoral shocks, are the primary factors responsible for unemployment fluctuations. This inference follows from two widely held beliefs: sectoral shocks induce only positive unemployment - vacancy comovements, while negative comovements are necessarily the result of aggregate demand shocks. This paper describes an equilibrium matching model that identifies plausible circumstances in which neither assumption is correct, thus suggesting that unemployment - vacancy data are inconclusive. Interestingly, this model's novel results are due to standard features in the contracting literature: firms experience relative price shocks and negotiate contracts that prescribe temporary layoffs.

ID MARKET
AB This paper attributes shortages of goods in socialist economies to the soft financial constraints that firms in such economies face. A ''soft budget constraint'' problem arises when the state bank is unable to make a credible commitment not to refinance bad projects once some investment costs are sunk. In such a situation, if a consumer good is also demanded by firms as an input and the seller cannot separate firms from households, the high market-clearing price would lead to welfare losses because too many bad projects would start and crowd out household consumption.

AB The high income elasticity of demand often estimated for US. imports may be a spurious result of omitting new product varieties from the import price indexes. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to incorporate new product varieties into a constant-elasticity-of-substitution aggregate of import prices. This method is applied to U.S. imports of six disaggregate manufactured goods. It is shown that the corrected indexes are able to account for part - but not all-of the high income elasticities.

ID MORAL HAZARD; EQUITY; TEAMS
AB The canonical problem of equity in production economies consists of two agents with different tastes and abilities, each of whom contributes labor to produce a single consumption good. As a criterion for distributive justice, I require that if both agents work equal numbers of hours, they should divide the output equally. I also require that the labor-supply decision should remain sovereign. Sufficient conditions are established for achieving an efficient allocation using a division procedure that is consistent with the equal-division-for-equal-work principle, and it is shown that the conditions are satisfied in many standard economies.

ID INNOVATION; INFORMATION
AB We analyze the problem faced by a financially weak independent inventor when selling a valuable, but easily imitated, invention for which no property rights exist. The inventor can protect his or her intellectual property by negotiating a contingent contract (with a buyer) prior to revealing the invention or, alternatively, the inventor can reveal the invention and then negotiate with the newly informed buyer. Despite the risk of expropriation, we find that, in equilibrium, an inventor with little wealth can expect to appropriate a sizable share of the market value of the invention by adopting the latter approach.

   MONOPOLY; RENEGOTIATION; RESTRAINTS; DURATION
AB An input supplier selling to competing downstream firms would benefit from publicly committing at the outset to all contracts. Efficient commitment, however, would require complete contracts. We study instead bilateral contracting, without commitment regarding others' terms. Each firm then fears that the supplier might opportunistically renegotiate another's contract to increase bilateral profit at the firm's expense. We show that nondiscrimination clauses generally cannot curb such third-party opportunism, even with symmetric firms. To reassure firms, crude forms of commitment may be adopted. This could explain the pervasiveness of exclusivity arrangements and the striking uniformity and intertemporal rigidity of franchise contracts.

The distortion is large, however, for particular groups of the population such as welfare claimants.

In contrast to well-known results for market goods with close substitutes (i.e., candy bars and coffee mugs), our results indicate a convergence of WTP and WTA measures of value. However, for a nonmarket good with imperfect substitutes (i.e., reduced health risk), the divergence of WTP and WTA value measures is persistent, even with repeated market participation and full information on the nature of the good.

AB This paper considers a buyer-seller relationship with observable but unverifiable investments and/or random utility parameters. In such situations, it is known that contract renegotiation may prevent the implementation of first-best outcomes. In this paper, we show however that efficient investments and optimal risk-sharing can typically be achieved provided the initial contract is able to monitor the ex post renegotiation process. Specifically, we focus on the following two features of renegotiation design. First, default options in case renegotiation breaks down; second, the allocation of all bargaining power to either contracting party. Moreover, we show that these two features can be obtained in standard Rubinstein bargaining games through contractual provisions, such as specific-performance clauses and penalties for delay (or, equivalently, financial ''hostages'' refundable without interest).

AB In conformity with the Savage model of decision-making, modem asset pricing theory assumes that agents' beliefs about the likelihoods of future states of the world may be represented by a probability measure. As a result, no meaningful distinction is allowed between risk, where probabilities are available to guide choice, and uncertainty, where information is too imprecise to be summarized adequately by probabilities. In contrast, Knight and Keynes emphasized the distinction between risk and uncertainty and argued that uncertainty is more common in economic decision-making. Moreover, the Savage model is contradicted by evidence, such as the Ellsberg Paradox, that people prefer to act on known rather than unknown or vague probabilities. This paper provides a formal model of asset price determination in which Knightian uncertainty plays a role. Specifically, we extend the Lucas (1978) general equilibrium pure exchange economy by suitably generalizing the representation of beliefs along the lines suggested by Gilboa and Schmeidler. Two principal results are the proof of existence of equilibrium and the characterization of equilibrium prices by an ''Euler inequality.'' A noteworthy feature of the model is that uncertainty may lead to equilibria that are indeterminate, that is, there may exist a continuum of equilibria for given fundamentals. That leaves the determination of a particular equilibrium price process to ''animal spirits'' and sizable volatility may result. Finally, it is argued that empirical investigation of our model is potentially fruitful.

AB We study the indeterminacy of equilibria in infinite horizon capital accumulation models with technological externalities. Our investigation encompasses models with bounded and unbounded accumulation paths, and models with one and two sectors of production. Under reasonable assumptions we find that equilibria are locally unique in one-sector economies. In economies with two sectors of production it is instead easy to construct examples where a positive external effect induces a two-dimensional manifold of equilibria converging to the same steady state (in the bounded case) or to the same constant growth rate (in the unbounded case). For the latter we point out that the dynamic behavior of these equilibria is quite complicated and that persistent fluctuations in their growth rates are possible.

AB The Bertrand-Edgeworth (BE) model describes competition among a group of price setting sellers, each of whom faces a production capacity constraint. We report on laboratory experiments that were designed so as to capture essential features of BE competition. These experiments permit us to evaluate different theories of BE competition: Competitive equilibrium (CE) pricing, Edgeworth cycles in prices, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) in prices, and tacit collusion.
   The experimental results indicate that while each of the theories helps to explain some aspects of the data, none of these theories are completely consistent with the data. In relative terms, the Edgeworth cycle theory provides better predictions than the other three theories. Most sellers adjusted their prices partially to their predicted Edgeworth price. The Edgeworth cycle theory is the only theory that predicts the kind of time dependence and cycling that was observed in most experiments.

It derives maximum likelihood (ML) and linearized ML tests and calculates size corrections to the order 1/T. The local power function of the size-corrected tests is the same to the order 1/T, irrespective of the form of the test statistic or the limited information estimator used in its computation. Finally, it compares these tests with two previously proposed tests.

AB The 1980's witnessed rapid changes in the structure of wages in the United States. In this study, recently developed techniques for quantile regression are applied to every March Current Population Survey since 1964 and changes in the return to schooling and experience at different points of the wage distribution are examined. The quantile regression technique parsimoniously describes the entire conditional wage distribution. This conditional distribution is used to examine changes in within-group wage inequality as measured by the difference between conditional quantiles. Two linear models are considered: a simple one-group model, and a 16-group model. The results suggest that the returns to schooling and experience differ across quantiles of the wage distribution but their patterns of change are similar. Significant differences in wage inequality are also found across the various skill groups. The paper also presents a new imputation method for CPS data.

AB The paper analyses the old and new challenges to the theory and policy of Free Trade. The old challenges have sought to undermine the case for Free Trade by citing one or another type of market imperfection. Thus, the postwar period has seen two such challenges: factor market imperfections were analysed in the 1950s to 1970s, product market imperfections in the 1980s. The new challenges are twofold. One comes from the demands for Fair Trade as a precondition for Free Trade; the other, from the concern that Free Trade, while efficient, immiserises the unskilled in the richer countries.

AB This paper considers a possible explanation for asymmetric adjustment of nominal prices. We present a menu-cost model in which positive trend inflation causes firms' relative prices to decline automatically between price adjustments. In this environment, shocks that raise firms' desired prices trigger larger price responses than shocks that lower desired prices. We use this model of asymmetric adjustment to address three issues in macroeconomics: the effects of aggregate demand, the effects of sectoral shocks, and the optimal rate of inflation.

AB Decomposing the post-tax Gini coefficient across groups of pre-tax equals reveals the separate contributions to the redistributive effect of an income tax of: (i) the effective schedule (we call this the 'vertical effect'), (ii) the unequal treatment of equals arising from departures from this effective schedule (the 'horizontal effect') and (iii) the reranking of unequals as a result of such departures (the 'reranking effect'). The methodology is applied to UK microdata. Throughout the period 1978-1991, reranking understates the (negative) contribution to redistributive effect of unequal tax treatment by about one third, and is far outweighed by the vertical effect.

AB This paper examines the relationship between exchange rate changes and Japanese export pricing behaviour employing a methodology which permits the separate measurement of pricing to market behaviour and the cost impact of exchange rate changes. The results suggest that incomplete pass-through of exchange rate changes is a pervasive phenomenon, but rejects the widely held view that Japanese export firms have relied more heavily on pricing to market strategies during the period of yen appreciation in order to maintain market shares. There is also evidence that estimates which capture only pricing to market behaviour may over-emphasise the degree of pass-through to the extent that cost of production is sensitive to exchange rate changes.

AB We consider a sequential decision model in which entrepreneurs decide on whether to enter a potential new market. Individual entrepreneurs have private expectations about the new market's viability. Over time, they learn about its viability from their own experience as well as that of earlier entrepreneurs. The distribution of the private expectations is said to be heterogeneous if external prior beliefs about the market's viability exist. We show that heterogeneity of expectations cuts both ways: while it facilitates the birth of viable markets, it also generates, via the existence of extremal beliefs, 'excessive' entry in non-viable markets.

AB The United States has been the labour productivity leader in manufacturing since the early nineteenth century despite changes in technological leadership from Britain to the United States and then to Germany and Japan. US productivity leadership is based on the more widespread use of mass production rather than craft production methods, determined by resource and factor endowments and demand patterns. The two systems can coexist so tong as the technologically lagging system imitates and adapts. Changes in the relative dynamism of the two systems explain changes in technological leadership, but without necessarily leading to changes in productivity leadership.

AB The ratio of a long government bond yield to the equity market divided yield, the Gilt-Equity Yield Ratio (GEYR), is commonly used by analysts in the UK as a mean, of determining the cheapness of equity investment relative to investment in gilts. Analysts use the ratio to predict future movements in equity prices using buy/sell thresholds, implicitly assuming that there is a long-run arbitrage relation between the equity market and the government bond market. A formal econometric analysis confirms that the GEYR is indeed a useful predictor of equity returns in the UK.

AB Three designs of auctions with quality thresholds are considered. The quality threshold is not known with certainty by the bidders. In one scheme quality plans submitted by potential bidders are evaluated first and price bids for only those plans which have been approved are invited. The second scheme has price bids first to yield a priority for scrutinising quality. A third has simultaneous decisions on price and quality. The model yields an equivalence result. The use of reserve prices to produce social optimality is then investigated. The theory is used to discuss the recent auction for UK television franchises.

AB This paper suggests that behaviour under uncertainty depends not only on rational expectations but also the agent's evaluation of the adequacy of the available evidence on which the expectations are based. It is argued that behavioural functions need to be augmented by a credence variable. This proposition is derived from Keynes's argument in the General Theory that investment depends on both the most probable forecast and the state of confidence, reflecting the distinction between probability and weight in his A Treatise on Probability. The research implications of the proposed model are indicated.

AB The paper examines the impact of housing equity and occupational pension scheme membership on job tenure. Using job duration data from the 1985 General Household Survey, appropriate hazard functions are constructed and estimated. Housing equity data is constructed from GHS, with appropriate adjustment for selection on house movers. Housing equity has a negative impact on male job tenure which is more pronounced the longer the job lasts. In contrast, pension scheme membership raises average tenure, in accordance with other studies, but the results show variation according to pension scheme characteristics.

AB Rationing is a pervasive feature of credit markets. It has been suggested that credit rationing represents a sub-optimal allocation of resources. In a general equilibrium model of credit rationing with hidden information and costly monitoring we show that if credit is rationed it is sub-optimal but that credit should be rationed more tightly. In equilibrium loan applicants bear average monitoring costs, whereas for efficiency they should bear marginal monitoring costs which are larger because average monitoring costs increase with quantity as extra loans are accompanied by a rise in the interest rate which increases the number of defaults.

AB This paper tests the main implications of models of irreversible investment using data from operations in the oil fields in the North Sea. Discrete-time hazard regression models are used to ascertain the influence of economic variables, the expected price of oil, the variance of the price of oil and the level of reserves, on the lag between the discovery of a field and the decision to develop the field. We are able to control for heterogeneity in the data by incorporating variables which account for both the geological features of each field and individual operator characteristics. The results indicate that the expected price of oil and the level of reserves are important in influencing the appraisal duration but that the variance of the oil price is not. Variables capturing the non-economic features of the individual fields are also found to be significant factors affecting the appraisal lag.

AB The process by which agents form expectations on price and cost inflation is investigated. Measures of expectations of these series, derived from qualitative survey responses in nine industrial sectors covering UK manufacturing between 1972-1989, are described, and the 'rationality' of these expectations tested. Rationality is not rejected in many sectors, and the evidence against rationality much weakened in other sectors, if tests take into account a particular form of conversion error. The possible effect of aggregation bias in the tests is noted, as rationality is rejected with more confidence with aggregated data than when the sectoral data is considered individually.

AB In the traditional Keynesian and classical models, the transmission of product demand changes to the labour market generally involves wage-price sluggishness or counter-cyclical real wage movements. In practice, however, real wages are often acyclical or procyclical, and wages and prices are flexible over periods of several years. This paper examines the main channels whereby product demand can affect employment under these conditions. The analysis suggests that the effectiveness of demand management policies under wage-price flexibility depends significantly on the availability of a limited number of supply-side transmission channels.

The restriction of the general model to the production smoothing specification is accepted for 4 out of 6 of the production to stock industries and for total non-durables.
   The estimation results do not suggest any use of inventories to smooth the level of production, but there is evidence of smoothing of the rate of change of production for 3 Production to stock industries and for both total non-durables and total durables.

AB Two sources of inefficiency in the provision of on-the-job training are examined: an externality between firs which arises if there is imperfect competition between firms in the labour market, and allocation inefficiency due to asymmetry of information about the value of the trained worker. The second source of inefficiency may compound the first. Various contracts between the worker and the training firm are considered. Analysis of a simple example suggests that a contract in which the wage is chosen by the firm performs best, according to the criteria of reducing both types of inefficiency.

It presents a method to distinguish between the effects of duration dependence and unobserved heterogeneity on the exit rate out of unemployment. It turns out that for British male unemployed there is strong genuine negative duration dependence. For French unemployed there is no strong duration dependence during the first year of unemployment, while for Dutch unemployed there is non-monotonic duration dependence. For all groups of French and Dutch individuals significant unobserved heterogeneity is found. For UK male unemployed, heterogeneity seems to be empirically unimportant.

If the elasticity of substitution between private goods and leisure exceeds one, the tax rate increases, thereby reducing private consumption. However, if labour supply bends backwards, private utility rises while the tax rate and public consumption fall. With imperfect substitution between private and public consumption, greener policies boost labour supply if the substitution elasticity between private and public consumption and the elasticity of the effectiveness of public abatement are small and the labour supply curve bends backwards.

In a market with known interest rates and uncertain service, the depositor must locate satisfactory bank service. The depositor who establishes a good reputation with the satisfactory bank; enjoys improved relationship-specific service. The improvement produces utility gains from remaining with the bank. These gains result in tradeoff. In the long-run of this market, when banks are forward looking, such switching costs facilitate monopsonistic determination of deposit rates.

AB A general equilibrium model based on the parable of an economy of many islands shows that market imperfections in the intermediation activity affect economic growth and possibly prevent takeoff into sustained growth. The inhabitants of different islands accumulate heterogeneous assets and transportation-type intermediation allows for better allocation of the productive resources. The development process is accompanied by a reduction in intermediation costs, which induces firms to adopt more efficient techniques and sustains economic growth. A laissez-faire economy suffers from two distortions: the existence of market imperfections and a 'thick market' externality.

AB Most markets clear through a sequence of sales rather than through a Walrasian auctioneer. Because buyers can decide whether to buy now or later, rather than only now or never, their current ''willingness to pay'' is much more sensitive to price than the demand curve is. A consequence is that markets will be extremely sensitive to new information, leading to both ''frenzies,'' in which demand feeds on itself, and ''crashes,'' in which price drops discontinuously. The paper also shows how a result from static auction theory, the revenue equivalence theorem, can be applied to solve for a dynamic price path.

ID GROWTH; IMITATION
AB This paper studies the evolution of a competitive industry in which a fixed number of firms reduce costs by innovating and by imitating their rivals' technologies. As the firms' technologies gradually improve, industry output expands and price falls. Technological leaders tend to rely on innovations to reduce their costs, whereas the laggards rely more on imitation. Imitation causes technology to spread from the leaders to the followers and forces some convergence of technology among firms as the industry matures. This convergence is accompanied by faster growth of smaller firms and a consequent tightening of the distribution of output over firms. Since imitation is a kind of spillover of technology, equilibrium is likely to involve insufficient innovative and imitative effort relative to a social optimum.

ID MODELS; EXIT
AB We examine why some individuals survive as entrepreneurs and others do not. In addition, we analyze the growth of entrepreneurial enterprises, conditional on surviving. Our focus is on the role of access to capital: To what extent do liquidity constraints increase the likelihood of entrepreneurial failure? The empirical strategy is based on the following logic: If entrepreneurs cannot borrow to attain their profit-maximizing levels of capital, then those entrepreneurs who have substantial personal financial resources will be more successful than those who do not. The data consist of the 1981 and 1985 federal individual income tax returns of a group of people who received inheritances. These data allow us to identify those individuals who were sole proprietors in 1981 and to determine the extent to which the decision to remain a sole proprietor was influenced by the magnitude of the inheritance-induced increase in liquidity. The results are consistent with the notion that liquidity constraints exert a noticeable influence on the viability of entrepreneurial enterprises.  For example, a $150,000 inheritance increases the probability that an individual will continue as a sole proprietor by 1.3 percentage points, and if the enterprise survives, its receipts increase by almost 20 percent.

TI SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION, JOB SECURITY, AND EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS -
   EVIDENCE FROM SELECTED OECD COUNTRIES
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID LABOR DEMAND; LAYOFFS; UNEMPLOYMENT; COSTS
AB In this paper, a model of optimal employment contracting describes differences across countries in firing restrictions and short-time compensation systems for workers forced to work shorter hours to avoid layoff. The model predicts that the existence of a short-time compensation (STC) system will generate major fluctuations in working hours only if the STC system is more generous than the traditional unemployment insurance system. A test performed for 10 OECD countries shows that in countries with generous STC systems, the speed of adjustment of total hours worked is higher than in the United States, despite a much slower adjustment in the number of workers employed. On the other hand, in countries with less generous STC systems, hours adjustments are far from compensating the slower employment adjustments.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
AB Focusing on the Southern Bell Telephone Company, we propose a modified version of the predation hypothesis to explain Bell's ''natural'' monopoly over local telephone service. Southern Bell effectively eliminated competition through a strategy of pricing below cost in response to entry, which deprived competitors of the cash flow required for expansion even if it failed to induce exit; investing in toll tines ahead of demand, isolating independent companies in smaller towns and rural areas, and forcing them to consolidate on favorable terms; and influencing local regulatory policy in large cities to weaken rivals and ultimately to institutionalize the Bell monopoly.

AB A model of competitive stock trading is developed in which investors are heterogeneous in their information and private investment opportunities and rationally trade for both informational and noninformational motives. I examine the link between the nature of heterogeneity among investors and the behavior of trading volume and its relation to price dynamics. It is found that volume is positively correlated with absolute changes in prices and dividends. I show that informational trading and noninformational trading lead to different dynamic relations between trading volume and stock returns.

AB This study estimates a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function using market data and microeconometric methods. We investigate the decision whether to purchase insurance against the risk of telephone line trouble in the home. Using the choices of approximately 10,000 residential customers, we determine the shape of the utility function and the degree of risk aversion. We find that risk aversion varies systematically in the population and varies with the level of income and that the observed choice behavior is consistent with expected utility maximization.

TI BEQUEST AS A PUBLIC GOOD WITHIN MARRIAGE - A NOTE
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
AB Bequest to and marriage of children can lead to a Pareto-inefficient allocation. The inefficiency (or market failure) arises because one family, making a bequest to its own child, ignores the contribution to the utility of the other family whose child enters the marriage. This note shows that an assortative mating rule based on bequests can improve or even restore Pareto efficiency when parents take account of the rule in deciding the amount of bequests to their own children.

AB Journal editors who publish papers authored by colleagues and former graduate students have been charged with practicing favoritism, with the implication that the papers in question are of lower quality than those written by scholars with no ties to the editor. Using citation analysis, we find strong evidence that although journal editors occasionally publish subpar papers authored by colleagues and former graduate students, on balance their use of professional connections enables them to identify and ''capture'' high-impact papers for publication. This implies that a practice interpreted as ''favoritism'' by many scholars in fact serves to enhance efficiency in the market for scientific knowledge.

AB In the period since the 1960s, as in other periods, aggregate time series on real wages have displayed only modest cyclicality. Macroeconomists therefore have described weak cyclicality of real wages as a salient feature of the business cycle. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, our analysis of longitudinal microdata indicates that real wages have been substantially procyclical since the 1960s. We show that the true procyclicality of real wages is obscured in aggregate time series because of a composition bias: the aggregate statistics are constructed in a way that gives more weight to low-skill workers during expansions than during recessions.

AB This paper assesses the impact of employer-provided health insurance on job mobility by exploring the extent to which workers are ''locked'' into their jobs because preexisting conditions exclusions make it expensive for individuals with medical problems to relinquish their current health insurance. I estimate the degree of job-lock by comparing the difference in the turnover rates of those with high and low medical expenses for those with and without employer-provided health insurance. Using data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey, I estimate that job-lock reduces the voluntary turnover rate of those with employer-provided health insurance by 25 percent, from 16 percent to 12 percent per year.

AB Examination of household (micro) data on the elderly has generally concluded that they do not dissave significantly, whereas estimates using aggregate (macro) data have shown that the presence of a large elderly population leads to a lower saving rate. This paper shows that if interactions between generations are important, one would not expect these estimates to be the same. The paper presents new evidence that bequests are plausibly the source of this discrepancy. Examination of data from young households that have received or expect bequests confirms that bequests are indeed an important factor determining the saving of the young.

AB In the context of an overlapping-generations model, we show that liquidity constraints on households (i) raise the saving rate, (ii) strengthen the effect of growth on saving, (iii) increase the growth rate if productivity growth is endogenous, and (iv) may increase welfare. The first three positions are supported by cross-country regressions of saving and growth rates on indicators of liquidity contraints on households. The results suggest that financial deregulation in the 1980s has contributed to the decline in national saving and growth rates in the OECD countries.

ID LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS; HYPOTHESIS
AB This paper tests a straightforward implication of the basic Life Cycle model of consumption: that current consumption depends on expected lifetime income. The paper projects future income for a panel of households and finds that consumption is closely related to projected current income, but unrelated to predictable changes in income. However, future income uncertainty has an important effect: consumers facing greater income uncertainty consume less. The results are consistent with ''buffer-stock'' models of consumption like those of Deaton [1991] or Carroll [1992a, 1992b], where precautionary motives greatly reduce the willingness of prudent consumers to consume out of uncertain future income.
