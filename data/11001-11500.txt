AB We propose a nonparametric estimation procedure for continuous-time stochastic models. Because prices of derivative securities depend crucially on the form of the instantaneous volatility of the underlying process, we leave the volatility function unrestricted and estimate it nonparametrically. Only discrete data are used but the estimation procedure still does not rely on replacing the continuous-time model by some discrete approximation. Instead the drift and volatility functions are forced to match the densities of the process. We estimate the stochastic differential equation followed by the short-term interest rate and compute nonparametric prices for bonds and bond options.

AB Suppose an observed time series is generated by a stochastic volatility model-i.e., there is an unobservable state variable controlling the volatility of the innovations in the series. As shown by Nelson (1992), and Nelson and Foster (1994), a misspecified ARCH model will often be able to consistently (as a continuous time limit is approached) estimate the unobserved volatility process, using information in the lagged residuals. This paper shows how to more efficiently estimate such a volatility process using information in both lagged and led residuals. In particular, this paper expands the optimal filtering results of Nelson and Foster (1994) and Nelson (1994) to smoothing and to filtering with a random initial condition.

AB This paper provides a proof of the consistency and asymptotic normality of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator in GARCH(1,1) and IGARCH(1,1) models. In contrast to the case of a unit root in the conditional mean, the presence of a ''unit root'' in the conditional variance does not affect the limiting distribution of the estimators; in both models, estimators are normally distributed. In addition, a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix is available, enabling the use of standard test statistics for inference.

AB This paper proposes some tests for parameter constancy in linear regressions. The tests use weighted empirical distribution functions of estimated residuals and are asymptotically distribution free. The local power analysis reveals that the proposed tests have nontrivial local power against a wide range of alternatives. In particular, the tests are capable of detecting error heterogeneity that is not necessarily manifested in the form of changing variances. The model allows for both dynamic and trending regressors. The residuals may be obtained based on any root-n consistent estimator (under the null) of regression parameters. As an intermediate result, some weak convergence for (stochastically) weighted sequential empirical processes is established.

TI Federal fiscal constitutions: Risk sharing and moral hazard
SO ECONOMETRICA
LA English

DE fiscal federalism; constitutions; risk sharing; principal-agent models
AB We study the collective choice of fiscal policy in a ''federation'' with two levels of government. Local policy redistributes across individuals and affects the probability of aggregate shocks, whereas federal policy shares international risk. There is a tradeoff between risk-sharing and moral hazard: federal risk-sharing may induce local governments to enact policies that increase local risk. We analyze this tradeoff under alternative fiscal constitutions. In particular, we contrast a vertically ordered system like the EC with a horizontally ordered federal system like the US. Alternative arrangements create different incentives for policymakers and voters, and give rise to different political equilibria. Under appropriate institutions, centralization of functions and power can mitigate the moral hazard problem.

AB In most states, unemployment insurance recipients accepting part-time work can earn up to a specific amount (the ''disregard'') with no reduction in benefits. Benefits are then reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for earnings in excess of the disregard. The disregard varies both across states and within a state over time. This paper analyzes the effects of changes in the disregard on job search behavior. A continuous-time job search model is developed and under general conditions an increase in the disregard is shown to increase both the part-time and overall re-employment hazards. Data from the Current Population Survey's Displaced Worker Supplements are used to test these predictions. Estimates from a competing risks model with correlated risks and time-varying coefficients shows that increasing the disregard significantly increases the conditional probability of part-time re-employment during the first three months of joblessness.

AB Theoretical literature on the economics of technology has emphasised the effects on technological trajectories of positive feedbacks. In a competition among technologies that all perform a similar function, the presence of increasing returns to adoption can force all but one technology from the market. Furthermore, the victor need not be the superior technology. This paper provides an empirical study of one technological competition which illuminates this theoretical work. It uses theoretical results to explain why chemical control of agricultural pests remains the dominant technology in spite of many claims that it is inferior to its main competitor, integrated pest management.

ID REAL EXCHANGE-RATE; NAIRU
AB In this paper we outline a method, termed 'theoretical deconstruction', which allows the system properties of any econometric macromodel to be related to a simpler theoretical model. First, elements of the econometric model which involve significant additional theoretical complexity compared to the theory model are removed. This process continues until the properties of the 'deconstructed' econometric model match those of the reference theory. Second, the econometric model is gradually reconstructed, noting at each point how each element of additional complexity influences the model properties. The technique is illustrated using fiscal policy changes and the UK econometric model COMPACT.

AB This paper estimates the magnitude of net capital gains on household wealth in Japan and then conducts an econometric analysis of their impact on consumption using National Accounts data for the 1955-93 period. It finds that net capital gains on household wealth have been sizeable albeit volatile in Japan during this period and that their impact on consumption has been substantial, especially during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The econometric analysis is one of the first cointegration analyses of Japanese consumption behaviour and finds strong support for the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis.

AB Using a high quality weekly data set we provide several rests of the expectations hypothesis EH, using the VAR and cointegration methodologies, for several maturities between 1-week and 12-months, far the UK interbank market. On the basis of the Johansen cointegration analysis there appears to be a 'break' in the term structure when both the six-month and twelve-month maturities are included as a pair. The latter may be due to either the presence of liquidity constraints or, market segmentation or, a time varying term premium, all of which would invalidate the assumptions underlying the EH. We provide some tentative explanations of these diverse results.

AB In a two-level ultimatum game one player offers an amount to two other players who then, in the case of acceptance, divide this amount by playing an ultimatum game. The first offer has to be accepted by the second proposer. Only the first proposer knew the true cake size whose a priori-probabilities were commonly known. The fact that most proposers with the large cake offered two thirds of the small cake has important implications for the theory of distributive justice better informed parties do not question that others want a fair share and, thus, pretend fairness by 'hiding behind some small cake'.

AB This paper studies the effect of foreign aid on economic stabilisation. Following Alesina and Drazen (1991), we model the delay in stabilising as the result of a distributional struggle. Since the delay is used to signal each faction's strength, the effect of the transfer depends on the role it plays in the release of information. We show that this role depends on the timing of the transfer: foreign aid decided and transferred sufficiently early into the game leads to earlier stabilisation; but aid decided or transferred too late is destabilising and encourages further postponement of reforms.

AB In this paper we suggest an alternative explanation of the high cross-section association between shares of saving and investment in GDP which Feldstein and Horioka (1980) interpret as evidence of low capital mobility. In OECD countries, saving and investment shares appear to be I(1). We show that a solvency constraint implies that the current balance is stationary and thus that saving and investment cointegrate with a unit coefficient irrespective of the degree of capital mobility. It is this long-run relation that the FH cross-section regression captures. Econometric results for 23 OECD countries over the 1960-92 period are consistent with this explanation.

AB This paper relates the erosion of the custom of shotgun marriage to the legalization of abortion and the increased availability of contraception to unmarried women in the United States. The decline in shotgun marriage accounts for a significant fraction of the increase in out-of-wedlock first births. Several models illustrate the analogy between women who do not adopt either birth control or abortion and the hand-loom weavers, both victims of changing technology. Mechanisms causing female immiseration are modeled and historically described. This technology-shock hypothesis is an alternative to welfare and job-shortage theories of the feminization of poverty.

ID DETERRENCE
AB Simultaneity between prisoner populations and crime rates makes it difficult to isolate the causal effect of changes in prison populations on crime. To break that simultaneity, this paper uses prison overcrowding litigation in a state as an instrument for changes in the prison population. The resulting elasticities are two to three times greater than those of previous studies. A one-prisoner reduction is associated with an increase of fifteen Index I crimes per year. While calculations of the costs of crime are inherently uncertain, it appears that the social benefits associated with crime reduction equal or exceed the social costs of incarceration for the marginal prisoner.

AB ''Defensive medicine'' is a potentially serious social problem: if fear of liability drives health care providers to administer treatments that do not have worthwhile medical benefits, then the current liability system may generate inefficiencies much larger than the costs of compensating malpractice claimants. To obtain direct empirical evidence on this question, we analyze the effects of malpractice liability reforms using data on all elderly Medicare beneficiaries treated fbr serious heart disease in 1984, 1987, and 1990. We find that malpractice reforms that directly reduce provider liability pressure lead to reductions of 5 to 9 percent in medical expenditures without substantial effects on mortality or medical complications. We conclude that liability reforms can reduce defensive medical practices.

TI Does public insurance crowd out private insurance?
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The cost of expanding public sector health programs depends critically on the extent to which public eligibility will cover just the uninsured, or will crowd out existing private insurance coverage. We estimate the extent of crowd-out arising from the expansions of Medicaid to pregnant women and children over the 1987-1992 period. We estimate that approximately 50 percent of the increase in Medicaid coverage was associated with a reduction in private insurance coverage. This occurred largely because employees took up employer-based insurance less frequently. There is also some evidence that employers contributed less for insurance and that workers dropped coverage of dependents.

AB We study the effect of public insurance for children on their utilization of medical care and health outcomes by exploiting recent expansions of the Medicaid program to low-income children. These expansions doubled the fraction of children eligible for Medicaid between 1984 and 1992. Take-up of these expansions was much less than full, however, even among otherwise uninsured children. Despite this take-up problem, eligibility for Medicaid significantly increased the utilization of medical care, particularly care delivered in physicians' offices. Increased eligibility was also associated with a sizable and significant reduction in child mortality.

AB We investigate the effect of abortion access on teen birthrates using county level panel data. Past research suggested that prohibiting abortion led to higher teen birthrates. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that more recent restrictions in abortion access, including the closing of abortion clinics and restrictions on Medicaid funding, had the opposite effect. Small declines in access were related to small declines among in-wedlock births; out-of-wedlock births were relatively unaffected. Both results are consistent with a simple model in which pregnancy is endogenous and women gain new information about the attractiveness of parenthood only after becoming pregnant.

AB The high variance of crime rates across time and space is one of the oldest puzzles in the social sciences; this variance appears too high to be explained by changes in the exogenous costs and benefits of crime. We present a model where social interactions create enough covariance across individuals to explain the high cross-city variance of crime rates. This model provides an index of social interactions which suggests that the amount of social interactions is highest in petty crimes, moderate in more serious crimes, and almost negligible in murder and rape.

The immigrant-native difference in the probability of receiving cash benefits is small, but the gap widens once other programs are included in the analysis: 21 percent of immigrant households receive some type of assistance, as compared with only 14 percent of native households. The types of benefits received by earlier immigrants influence the types of benefits received by newly arrived immigrants. Hence there might be ethnic networks that transmit information about the availability of particular benefits to new immigrants.

We identify the impact of TRA86 by comparing the change in labor supply of single women with children to the change for single women without children. We find that between 1984-1986 and 1988-1990, single women with children increased their relative labor force participation by up to 2.8 percentage points. We observe no change in the relative hours worked by single women with children who were already in the labor force.

Given the joint process of arbitrage-free asset prices, dividends, and aggregate income, satisfying a certain joint restriction, it is shown that this process is supported in the equilibrium of an economy with judiciously modeled income heterogeneity. The Euler equations of consumption in a representative-agent economy are replaced by a set of Euler equations that depend not only on the per capita consumption growth but also on the cross-sectional variance of the individual consumers' consumption growth.

AB A recent empirical literature has shaken economists' confidence in the value of aggregate (industry-level) data to illuminate production relationships. But the statistical finding ''you cannot aggregate,'' however well documented, is not an economic explanation. Plant-level relationships do aggregate in Depression-era blast furnace operations despite the presence of very substantial interplant heterogeneity, the most common economic cause of nonaggregability. The economic explanation of this lies in poor short-run substitutability of one plant's output for another's. Substitutability determines the importance of composition effects in understanding aggregate time series, constrains the potential cleansing effects of recessions, and therefore influences industry evolution quite broadly.

AB Recent research in international business cycles finds that international consumption comovements do not match the risk-sharing predictions of standard complete markets models. In this paper, I ask whether two different types of explanations can help explain this result: (1) nonseparabilities between tradables and nontradable leisure or goods and (2) the effects of capital market restrictions on consumption risk sharing. I find that risk sharing cannot be resolved by either explanation alone. However, when I allow for both nonseparabilities and certain market restrictions, risk sharing among unrestricted countries cannot be rejected. This evidence suggests that a combination of these two effects may be necessary to explain consumption risk sharing across countries.

Priced factors include the return on a stock index, revisions in forecasts of future stock returns (to capture intertemporal hedging effects), and revisions in forecasts of future labor income growth (proxies for the return on human capital). Aggregate stock market risk is the main factor determining excess returns; but in the presence of human capital or stock market mean reversion, the coefficient of relative risk aversion is much higher than the price of stock market risk.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English

ID UNITED-STATES; DEBT; VALUATION; OPTIONS; BONDS
AB Two hypotheses concerning firms issuing debt for the first time are tested. The first is that new firms' debt will be discounted more heavily by lenders, compared to firms that have credit histories (but are otherwise identical), and that this excess discount declines over time as lenders observe defaults. The declining interest rate corresponds to the formation of a ''reputation,'' a valuable asset that provides an incentive for firms not to choose risky projects. The second hypothesis is that prior to the establishment of a reputation, new firms issuing debt are monitored more intensely. The sample studied consists of new banks issuing bank notes for the first time during the American Free Banking Era (1838-60). The presence of a reputation effect in note prices is confirmed: the notes of new banks are discounted more heavily than the notes of banks with credit histories. Note holders are then motivated to monitor new banks because the excess discount provides an incentive for the notes of new banks to be redeemed. As lenders learn that new banks can redeem their notes, the discount declines as predicted for surviving banks. The precision of learning increases during the period because of technological improvements in information transmission, namely, the introduction of the telegraph and the railroad. The results explain why the pre-Civil War system of private money issuance by banks was not plagued by problems of overissuance (''wildcat banking'').

AB Under a progressive income tax, conventional wisdom is that taxing individuals rather than households is preferred from an efficiency point of view. The reason is that secondary workers, whose labor supply elasticity is high, will be taxed at a lower marginal rate than primary workers, whose labor supply elasticity is low. Here, we argue that once household production is taken into account, things are more complicated since tax design should also not distort the input of family members' time in household production. Factor input distortions as well as Ramsey considerations thus need to enter the choice of the tax unit. We provide a numerical example of an economy for which a move from an individual to a household basis in the income tax can be efficiency improving. We then use a general equilibrium model, parameterized using Australian tax rates and data, whose results clearly show that welfare gains can occur under changes from an individual to a household basis for an existing income tax. Our results thus challenge conventional wisdom and suggest that household unit taxation deserves more sympathetic consideration than is currently the case.

AB In this article we test whether the introduction of social insurance has led to a reduction in private insurance purchases and precautionary saving by examining the introduction of workers' compensation. Our empirical analysis is based on the financial decisions of over 7,000 households surveyed for the 1917-19 Bureau of Labor Statistics Cost-of-Living study. We find that the presence of workers' compensation at least partially crowded out private accident insurance and led to a substantial reduction in precautionary saving. The introduction of workers' compensation caused private saving to fall by approximately 25 percent, with other factors held constant.

AB When the profitability of investment depends on the general level of economic activity, entrepreneurs have an incentive to delay investments during a recession. Endogenous delay thus prolongs the recovery from a recession and heightens the effect of the boom. This paper describes a dynamic model that exhibits both delay and cycles and develops methods for analysing the role of delay in propogating business cycles. A number of interesting characteristics of the cycle are revealed. First, the effect of delay is asymmetric: it lengthens the recovery but not the downturn. Second, delay can increase the amplitude and typically reduces the frequency of the cycle. Third, it can reduce the average level of activity, but it achieves this effect by prolonging the recession rather than by reducing the amplitude of the cycle. The welfare effects of delay are ambiguous, however.

DT Article
ID MARRIED-WOMEN; YOUNG MEN; WORK; FERTILITY
AB This paper studies the interdependence between and the determinants of life-cycle marital status and labour force participation decisions of women. A dynamic utility maximization model is presented and estimated using longitudinal data on women from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The MLE method employed, involves solving a dynamic programming problem. Further, a minimum distance estimator is proposed which allows for the incorporation of wage data in a computationally simple way. The estimates are used to predict changes in the life-cycle patterns of employment, marriage and divorce due to differences in education, race, the female's earnings and her (potential) husband's earnings. The estimation results indicate that the utility gains to marriage are decreasing in the female's wage rate and increasing in her (potential) husband's earnings, while the opposite is found for gains to working. Ignoring the endogeneity of marital status decisions is shown to lead to an underestimation of own and husband's;wage effects on female labour supply.

ID PUBLIC-EDUCATION; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; CHOICE; EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL
AB A general model of community formation and human capital accumulation with social spillovers and decentralized school funding is used to analyse the causes of economic segregation and its consequences for equity and efficiency. Significant polarization arises from minor differences in endowments, preferences or access to capital markets. This makes income inequality more persistent across generations, but the same need not be true for wealth. Equilibrium stratification tends to be excessive, resulting in low aggregate surplus. Whether state equalization of school resources can remedy these problems hinges on how purchased, social and family inputs interact in education and in mobility decisions.

The parties have fixed positions on some issues, but vary their positions on others in order to attract votes and campaign contributions. In this context, we examine whether special interest groups are governed by an electoral motive or an influence in their campaign giving, and how their contributions affect the equilibrium platforms. We show that each party is induced to behave as if it were maximizing a weighted sum of the aggregate welfares of informed voters and members of special interest groups. The party that is expected to win a majority of seats caters more to the special interests.

In the context of a simple parametric model, it is shown that the entrepreneur does not find it profitable to float an asset that affords her an informational advantage. The reason is that, with rational, uninformed outside investors, the entrepreneur faces adverse selection in the security market, which prevents her from exploiting her position as an insider. This is true whether or not she has market power in trading the asset.

ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH
AB We study a positive theory of stagnation and growth aimed at understanding the large variations in growth outcomes across actual economies. The theory points to the fundamental role played by vested interests in determining policies which are key to the growth process: some agents seek to prevent the adoption of new technologies. We develop a model of technology adoption, and show how technological innovation may sow the seeds of its own destruction. In particular, we find that the equilibrium is characterized by a long cycle of stagnation and growth. Over this cycle, incumbent innovators have sufficient political influence that new technologies are prohibited, and only as these incumbents are phased out of the economy will new innovation occur. In formalizing our theory we make a methodological contribution by characterizing dynamic voting equilibria in which voters must forecast the effects of different current policies on future prices and policy outcomes.

The parties each propose a policy, an election is held and the policy of the winning party is implemented. Voters and parties care about the level of the public good and costs. Two kinds of sequential equilibria exist; revealing, where voters learn the true costs and the implemented policy adjusts to costs, and non-revealing. If parties' preferences are polarized only non-revealing equilibria fulfill a refinement criterion like the intuitive criterion. If they are alike only revealing equilibria fulfill this criterion. Thus less political polarization improves information revelation.

The data collected for this purpose show that minorities are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as whites. Yet variables correlated with both race and creditworthiness were omitted from these data, making any conclusion about race's role in mortgage lending impossible, The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston collected additional variables important to the mortgage lending decision and found that race continued to play an important, though significantly diminished, role in the decision to grant a mortgage.

AB To explain the large differences in labor productivity across U.S. states we estimate two models-one based on local geographical externalities and the other on the diversity of local intermediate services-where spatial density results in aggregate increasing returns. Both models lead to a relation between county employment density and productivity at the state level. Using data on gross state output we find that a doubling of employment density increases average labor productivity by around 6 percent. More than half of the variance of output per worker across states can be explained by differences in the density of economic activity.

We show that actual forecastable movements in output have a variance about one hundred times larger than those predicted by the model. We also find that forecastable changes in the three series are strongly positively correlated with each other. On the other hand, for parameters whose implications are plausible in other respects, the model implies that output, consumption, and hours should not all be expected to move in the same direction.

Money is endogenous because both monetary policy and deposit creation are endogenous. Parameters are selected according to the simulated moments estimation technique. While the estimated model succeeds along some dimensions in matching properties of postwar U.S. data, its failure to match key patterns of lead-lag correlations seems to cast doubt on the ability of endogenous money determination, by itself to quantitatively account for the observed money-output correlations.

Incorporating labor-market search into the model is found to improve its empirical performance along several dimensions. In particular, hours now fluctuate substantially more than wages and the contemporaneous correlation between hours and productivity falls, in addition, the model replicates the observation that output growth displays positive autocorrelation at short horizons. Overall, the empirical results suggest that the labor-market-search environment embodies a quantitatively important propagation mechanism.

Max M. Weber refers to this desire for wealth as the spirit of capitalism. We examine, both analytically and empirically, implications of Weber's hypothesis for consumption, savings, and stock prices, When investors care about relative social status, propensity to consume and risk-taking behavior will depend on social standards, and stock prices will be volatile. The spirit of capitalism seems to be a driving force behind stock-market volatility and economic growth.

AB Economic theory suggests that uninsurable income risk and the expectation of future borrowing constraints can reduce the share of risky assets in a household's portfolio. If the utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing prudence, an individual will reduce his exposure to rate of return risks when confronted with other independent risks. If there are transaction costs, the expectation of future borrowing constraints should induce individuals to keep a lower proportion of their wealth in the form of illiquid and risky assets. We find support for these propositions in a cross-section of ltalian households (JEL D81, G11).

TI Auctions versus negotiations
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID TAKEOVER BIDS; STRATEGIES; DESIGN; PRICE
AB Which is the more profitable way to sell a company: an auction with no reserve price or art optimally-structured negotiation with one less bidder? We show under reasonable assumptions that the auction is always preferable when bidders' signals are independent. For affiliated signals, the result holds under certain restrictions on the seller's choice of negotiating mechanism. The result suggests that the value of negotiating skill is small relative to the value of additional competition. The paper also shows how the analogies between monopoly theory and auction theory can help derive new results in auction theory.

ID INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; INVESTMENTS; INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP; COSTS; FIRM
AB We consider a wide number of applications of an intrafirm bargaining game within organizations where employees and the firm engage in wage negotiations. Under our presumption that contracts cannot bind employees to the organization, the resulting stable wage and profit profiles give vise to art objective function for the firm that places weight on inframarginal profits in an economically significant manner. We in turn employ this methodology to explore applications of organizational design, hiring and capital decisions, training and cross-training, the importance of labor and asset specificity, managerial hierarchies, preferences for unionization, responses to competition, and internal capital budgeting.

TI Divisionalization, franchising, and divestiture incentives in oligopoly
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID HORIZONTAL MERGERS; EQUILIBRIUM; ENTRY; COMPETITION
AB A two-stage game is used to model firms' strategic incentives to divide production among autonomous competing units through divisionalization, franchising, or divestiture. Firms simultaneously choose their number of competing units, which then engage in Cournot competition. While it is costly to form autonomous units, each firm does so in equilibrium, thus reducing firm profits and increasing social welfare relative to the case where firms cannot form competing units. With linear demand and costs, duopolists choose the socially optimal number of competing units oligopolies with larger numbers of firms choose too many. The case of nonlinear demand is also examined.

ID UNCERTAINTY; EQUILIBRIA; OLIGOPOLY; CAPACITY; BERTRAND
AB This paper develops a model of capacity-price competition in which the equilibrium outcome ranges from the Bertrand to the Cournot outcome as capacity constraints become more important, This model is employed to reexamine aspects of strategic-trade-policy theory and, in particular, the theory's well-known sensitivity to the mode of oligopolistic competition. Among other things, the analysis identifies a simple single-rate policy, namely, capacity subsidies, which can increase the home country's income regardless of the mode of competition. This suggests that the presence of critical informational constraints need not diminish governments' incentives to distort the international competition.

   the 1840's
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID REPUDIATION
AB The defaults of U.S. States in the 1840's provide a powerful test of competing models of sovereign debt. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prevented foreign creditors from obtaining payment in the federal courts. Moreover, because the defaulting states were part of a large and economically integrated nation, creditors could not enforce payment by imposing military or trade sanctions. In spite of the lack of sanctions, however, most states eventually repaid in fill. It appears that the states repaid in order to maintain access to capital markets, much as in reputational models of sovereign debt.

ID TAXES; PROGRAM; MODELS; COSTS
AB This paper examines the effect of cash transfers and food stamp benefits on family labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent families. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Unemployed Parent Program has provided cash benefits to two-parent households since 1961. Despite recent expansions, little is known about the program's effect on labor supply and welfare participation. I develop a model of family labor supply in which hours of work for the husband and wife are chosen to maximize family utility subject to a family budget constraint accounting for AFDC-UP benefits and other tax and transfer programs. The husband's and wife's labor supply decisions are restricted to no work, part-time work, and full-time work. Maximum likelihood techniques are used to estimate parameters of the underlying hours of work and welfare participation equations. The estimates are used to determine the magnitude of the work disincentive effects of the AFDC-UP program, and to simulate the effects of changes in AFDC-UP benefit and eligibility rules on family labor supply and welfare participation. The results suggest that labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent families are highly responsive to changes in the benefit structure under the AFDC-UP program.

AB This paper examines how, in the presence of individual risk, economic efficiency can be achieved without an unrealistically large number of contingent claims. Market uncertainty is specified in such a way that general types of individual risk and collective risk are properly accounted for and so that, specifically, market clearing is always satisfied ex post as well as ex ante. We show that consistency of beliefs and optimality of allocation can be guaranteed with an appropriate array of pure Arrow securities to spread collective risk and mutual insurance policies to pool individual risk. When there is individual risk common to like groups of individuals, pooling risk by means of mutual insurance permits substantial economizing on market transactions, as compared to those required if dealing instead with the full complement of pure Arrow securities. We show that if there are N households (consisting of H types), each facing the possibility of being in S individual states together with T collective states, then ensuring Pareto optimality requires only H(S - 1)T independent mutual insurance policies plus T pure Arrow securities. Our results also help to clarify the question of which missing markets may affect allocational efficiency.

AB The aim of this paper is to explain the fact that certain properties of binary relations are frequently observed in natural language while others do not appear at all. Three features of binary relation are studied: (i) the ability to use the relation to indicate nameless elements; (ii) the accuracy with which the vocabulary spanned by the relation can be used to approximate the actual terms to which a user of the language wishes to refer; (iii) the ease with which the relation can be described by means of examples. It is argued that linear orderings are optimal according to the first criteria while asymmetric relations are optimal according to the second. From among complete and asymmetric relations (tournaments), those which are transitive are optimal according to the third criterion.

Moreover, we show that any variation (in a certain class) of our bargaining procedure which generates the Shapley value in the TU setup must yield the consistent value in the general NTU setup.

ID REGRESSION
AB This paper develops an asymptotic theory of Bayesian inference for time series. A limiting representation of the Bayesian data density is obtained and shown to be of the same general exponential form for a wide class of likelihoods and prior distributions. Continuous time and discrete time cases are studied. In discrete time, an embedding theorem is given which shows how to embed the exponential density in a continuous time process. From the embedding we obtain a large sample approximation to the model of the data that corresponds to the exponential density. This has the form of discrete observations drawn from a nonlinear stochastic differential equation driven by Brownian motion. No assumptions concerning stationarity or rates of convergence are required in the asymptotics. Some implications for statistical testing are explored and we suggest tests that are based on likelihood ratios (or Bayes factors) of the exponential densities for discriminating between models.

ID THRESHOLD AUTOREGRESSION; MODELS; TESTS
AB Many econometric testing problems involve nuisance parameters which are not identified under the null hypotheses. This paper studies the asymptotic distribution theory for such tests. The asymptotic distributions of standard test statistics are described as functionals of chi-square processes. In general, the distributions depend upon a large number of unknown parameters. We show that a transformation based upon a conditional probability measure yields an asymptotic distribution free of nuisance parameters, and we show that this transformation can be easily approximated via simulation. The theory is applied to threshold models, with special attention given to the so-called self-exciting threshold autoregressive model. Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the finite sample distributions. The tests are applied to U.S. GNP growth rates, and we find that Potter's (1995) threshold effect in this series can be possibly explained by sampling variation.

ID OWNERSHIP; POLAND; FIRMS
AB Public enterprises around the world have proved to be highly inefficient, primarily because they pursue strategies, such as excess employment, that satisfy the political objectives of politicians who control them. Privatisation of public enterprises can raise the cost to politicians of influencing them, since subsidies to private firms necessary to force them to remain inefficient are politically harder to sustain than wasted profits of the state firms. In this way, privatisation leads to efficient restructuring of firms. Moreover, privatisation is more effective when combined with a tight monetary policy, and when the new owners of firms are profit maximising investors, rather than their employees or even managers.

AB We used panel data for I,2I8 UK industrial and commercial companies between I970 and I990 to investigate whether dividends are affected by taxes. Cross-section variation in the tax cost of paying dividends results from surplus advance corporation tax (ACT) affecting some firms during this period. Observations on firms moving into and out of surplus ACT allow us to identify the effect of taxes whilst controlling for unobserved firm-specific influences. Our results suggest that the tax cost has a statistically significant and quantitatively important influence on dividends.

We find some change in the mean job tenure: a decrease in elapsed tenure of about I0% between I975 and I992. These are important changes, but they do not support the view that the dramatic changes in the labour market, technology and competition have spelt the end of 'jobs for life'.

AB That governments should delegate the operation of monetary policy to independent central banks is widely advocated. For a closed economy the optimal choice results in a banker who is more conservative than the representative government, assigning a lower weight on output in her welfare function, but not over-conservative, thereby allowing monetary policy to adjust to shocks. However, for open economies the exchange rate externality results in an inefficient Nash equilibrium to this 'delegation game'. Monetary union or cooperation in the optimal choice of banker can internalise the externality. These options are assessed under symmetric and asymmetric shocks assuming different levels of fiscal transfers.

Exogeneity tests suggest that financial deepening and economic growth are jointly determined. Thus, policies which affect financial deepening may also have an influence on economic growth.

AB This paper argues that most of the facts characterising small-scale businesses, including high failure rates, reliance on bank credit rather than equity finance, relatively low interest rate margins, and credit rationing, can be explained by a tendency for those who are excessively optimistic to dominate new entrants. Drawing on findings in psychology, we model entrants as relatively naive optimisers. Banks on the other hand are viewed as well informed and efficient processors of information.

Failure to attend the interview carries the threat of the cessation of unemployment benefits. The results, using experimental data, indicate that the programme has a significant effect of reducing unemployment duration. Estimation of an independent competing risks model distinguishing between exits from unemployment to: a job, a training placement or to signing-off unemployment benefit shows that the channels through which Restart works differs according to exit type.

AB Using personnel data from a large financial company, we find some evidence that women have to meet more stringent criteria than men for promotion, but that much of the difference between men and women's attainment is due to their attributes. For example, lack of work experience is more important quantitatively than 'Glass Ceilings' in preventing the preferment of women. Our data also suggest that the differential barriers confronting women are greatest at the lower end of the job ladder and that men and women may receive equal treatment once senior grades have been reached.

AB In some practical applications of transition models there is a natural limit on the duration of some state. An important example is the Youth Training Scheme (YTS), which is normally limited to 2 years. We modify the usual competing risks model for this case and derive a diagnostic test for heterogeneity. We apply the techniques to a model of the duration of YTS and find results that suggest an important qualitative effect of completed 2-year YTS spells compared to spells completed under 2 years. Full-term YTS spells are found to be associated with significantly higher employment probabilities.

AB This study investigates the exchange rate pass-through (PT) for Australian imports of manufactures. PT elasticities are estimated for total manufactures and 40 product categories by applying an econometric procedure which avoids the pit-falls in previous studies to a carefully assembled data set. The determinants of PT are analysed by relating the PT elasticities to variables representing foreign control, non-tariff barriers (NTBs), product characteristics and market structure. We find that PT is incomplete for most products, with significant variation across products. Unlike previous studies, we find that most of the variation in PT is explained by the presence of multinational corporations and NTBs.

AB The theory of irreversible investment predicts that development of an oil field should take place when a unique 'price trigger' is passed. At the start of the I99o/9I Gulf War, however, oil prices promptly doubled, only to fall back to their previous level when peace returned six months later. To incorporate such large but 'transitory' price hikes, we evaluate the profitability of an oil field contingent on war and peace and calculate separate triggers in each case. For plausible parameter values, we find that the switch between these development triggers is about 3/4 of the price hike caused by the war. The price hike is therefore equivalent to a permanent price increase of only a quarter of its size.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between investments in human capital and R & D in a model of endogenous growth. Both forms of investment exhibit pecuniary externalities and are, as a result, strategic complements. Multiple equilibria may occur for intermediate parameter values, and the present analysis may be seen as providing a theoretical rationalisation for the idea that an economy may become trapped in a 'low-skills' equilibrium, characterised by a poorly trained workforce and low product quality. In the presence of multiple equilibria, there may be a welfare-improving role for government policy in co-ordinating expectations.

AB The paper develops an overlapping generations framework of endogenous taxation. There are three types of heterogeneity among individuals: age, productivity, and bequest motives. The heterogeneity gives rise to a redistributive conflict and therefore to different preferences over fiscal policy. Linear taxes are levied on consumption expenditure, wage income and capital income. These tax rates and the provision of a public good become endogenous through a majority-voting rule. The dynamic politico-economic equilibrium is examined both in and outside the steady state. The focus is on the underlying characteristics of the economy that gives rise to a particular fiscal structure.

AB The issues of economies in transition have been a central topic in recent macroeconomic modelling. The attention of researchers has concentrated particularly on the speed of transition, and the sequence of restructuring and privatising the state sector. What seems to have been neglected so far are the monetary and financial issues, and the interaction of inflationary finance and real variables at the early stages of transition. This paper is an attempt to address these issues. The theoretical set-up recently proposed by Aghion and Blanchard (I993) is modified to capture the lack of an efficient tax system, the absence of financial intermediaries, and the exploitation of seigniorage.

AB This paper examines the role played by wage comparisons in pay bargaining when workers have a fall-back option. The effect on wages due to wage comparisons can be difficult to distinguish from the effect of the fall-back wage. It is shown that the use of wages of a recognised 'pay leader' resolves this problem. The empirical work employs a unique panel of data covering 32I unionised bargaining units in the UK chemicals industry between I978 and I989 Results support anecdotal reports of pay leadership and suggest that wages elsewhere matter because comparisons are important to workers. In this sense, the results support the notion that 'fairness considerations' drive wage interactions.

AB The theory of home production/time allocation is used to model the behaviour of the petty traders who predominate in marketing the surplus foodstuff of peasant farmers in Jamaica and in other LDCs. Analysis of the behaviour of petty traders in terms of rational responses to price and income changes shows that they may not always obey the laws of supply and demand due to the absence of an exogenous wage. The model should prove useful in empirical studies of economic behaviour in the informal sector of many economies.

ID BANKRUPTCY; CHOICE; MARKET; RULES
AB Within an optimal contracting framework, we analyze the optimal number of creditors a company borrows from. We also analyze the optimal allocation of security interests among creditors and inter-creditor voting rules that govern renegotiation of debt contracts. The key to our analysis is the idea that these aspects of the debt structure affect the outcome of debt renegotiation following a default, Debt structures that lead to inefficient renegotiation are beneficial in that they deter default, but they are also costly if default is beyond a manager's control. The optimal debt structure balances these effects. We characterize how the optimal debt structure depends on firm characteristics such as its technology, its credit rating, and the market for its assets.

A theoretical model of the federal funds market is proposed that could account for these empirical regularities as the result of line limits, transaction costs, and weekend accounting conventions. The paper concludes that such transaction costs lie at the heart of the liquidity effect that enables the Federal Reserve to change the interest rate on a daily basis.

AB Government may provide a good that can, if legally permitted, be supplemented by private purchases. Policy is determined by majority rule. Under standard assumptions on preferences, a majority voting equilibrium exists. A regime of positive government provision with no restriction on private supplements is shown to be majority preferred to a regime of either only market provision or only government provision. Combined public and private expenditure on the good is higher under this dual-provision regime than under either of the alternatives. Under some preference configurations, the median-income voter is pivotal; under others, a voter with income below the median is pivotal.

AB Core theory is a powerful tool to find competitive market-clearing prices. A familiar economic setting shows this, beginning with a single commodity produced using many factors of production and ending with the general case of many outputs and inputs. The analysis describes when the market has a core. When it has no core, there is a least upper bound on the payment each firm that does not participate in a central market must make that serves as an inducement to restore the core. Since each firm can avoid this penalty by trading in the central market, the result is market-clearing prices that can support an efficient equilibrium.

AB This paper investigates the implications of social rewards on the allocation of talent in society and consequently on the process of economic growth. We consider two sources of heterogeneity among workers: nonwage income and innate ability. A greater emphasis on status may induce the ''wrong'' individuals, that is, those with low ability and high wealth, to acquire schooling, causing workers with high ability and low wealth to leave the growth-enhancing industries. This crowding-out effect, taken alone, discourages growth. Growth may be enhanced by a more egalitarian distribution of wealth, which reduces the demand for status.

We estimate that the elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to total expenditure is 0.3-0.5, a range that is in accord with conventional wisdom. The elasticity declines only slowly with levels of living and is far from the value of zero suggested by a recent revisionist literature. In these Indian data, the calories necessary for a day's activity cost less than 5 percent of the daily wage, which makes it implausible that income is constrained by nutrition rather than the other way around.

It is unclear what values may arise from such activities, however. Evidence from transactions is incomplete and existing theoretical models are flawed. We calculate an upper bound on the value of the ''marginal species.'' Even under favorable assumptions this bound is modest. Slightly modified assumptions lead to drastically lower estimates. We extend our findings to the value of the marginal hectare of habitat and find that the incentives for habitat conservation generated by private pharmaceutical research are also, at best, very modest.

AB Built between 1974 and 1977, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was the largest privately financed construction project in world history. The Alaskan labor market during the pipeline era provides an ideal opportunity to view labor market responses to a large, anticipated, and temporary shock to labor demand. The paper presents several theoretical models of market responses to temporary demand shocks and then assesses the ability of each model to explain the Alaskan data. Among the findings are that Alaskan wages were very flexible, labor supply was quite elastic on both the intensive (hours per worker) and extensive (number of workers) margins, and even a major short-run demand shock need not have a long-run impact.

We also predict that strike activity is positively related to the difference in the salary levels of the unions' and boards' lists of comparables. We test these predictions using a unique combination of subjective survey and field data on teacher contract negotiations in Pennsylvania. Both hypotheses are supported by the data.

AB Professional forecasters may not simply aim to minimize expected squared forecast errors. In models with repeated forecasts the pattern of forecasts reveals valuable information about the forecasters even before the outcome is realized. Rational forecasters will compromise between minimizing errors and mimicking prediction patterns typical of able forecasters. Simple models based on this argument imply that forecasts are biased in the direction of forecasts typical of able forecasters. Our models of strategic bias are rejected empirically as forecasts are biased in directions typical of forecasters with large mean squared forecast errors. This observation is consistent with behavioral explanations of forecast bias.

We use a median voter model of the choice between trade and autarky embedded within an intraindustry trade model similar to Krugman. Our main result is the derivation of conditions under which a rich country rejects trade with middle-income countries, but accepts trade with either similar or poor countries. We also show that if increased inequality lowers median wealth in the developed country, the range of countries for which free trade is rejected is enlarged.

The equilibrium number of candidates depends negatively on the cost of running and positively on the benefits of winning. For some parameter values all equilibria under plurality rule have exactly two candidates, whose positions are distinct. Two-candidate elections are more likely under plurality rule than under a runoff system (cf. Duverger's Law). The candidates' positions are less differentiated under a runoff system. There exist equilibria under both systems in which some candidates have no chance of winning.

AB Despite a surplus of candidates for most teaching jobs, a strong academic record does little for an applicant's job prospects. This does not appear to result from lukewarm interest on the part of such applicants or choosiness about the positions they accept. Administrators' lack of interest in these candidates may reflect the weakness of competitive pressures in public education. Policies intended to improve teacher quality need to consider incentives on both the demand and supply sides of the market.

AB This paper develops a multicommunity model and analyzes policies that affect spending on public education and its distribution across communities. We find that policies that on net increase the fraction of the (relatively) wealthiest residents in the poorest community are welfare enhancing; policies that decrease this fraction can make all worse off. Appropriately financed policies to (i) redistribute income toward the poorest, (ii) increase spending on education in the poorest community, and (iii) make the poorest community more attractive to relatively wealthier individuals, produce chain reactions in which the quality of education increases and tax rates fall in all communities.

AB We report experiments on how players select among multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria in a coordination game. Subjects initially choose inefficient equilibria. Charging a fee to play (which makes initial equilibria money-losing) creates coordination on better equilibria. When fees are optional, improved coordination is consistent with forward induction. But coordination improves even when subjects must pay the fee (forward induction does not apply). Subjects appear to use a ''loss-avoidance'' selection principle: they expect others to avoid strategies that always result in losses. Loss-avoidance implies that ''mental accounting'' of outcomes can affect choices in games.

AB This paper examines the impact of technological innovation on wages using a panel of British firms. A head-count measure of major innovations between 1945 and 1983 is combined with share price and accounting information Innovating firms are found to have higher average wages, but rival innovation tends to depress own wages. This appears consistent with a model where wages are partly determined by a sharing in the rents generated by innovation. In other words, innovation may be a good instrument for proxies for rents such as profitability, quasi rents, or Tobin's (average) Q. Instrumental variable estimates of the elasticity between wages and quasi rents are about 0.29.

Using an unbalanced panel from the manufacturing sector it shows that a rise in a sector's profitability leads after some years to an increase in the long-run level of wages in that sector. The paper controls for workers' characteristics, for industry fixed effects, and for unionism. Lester's range of wages is estimated, for rent-sharing reasons alone, at approximately 24 percent of the mean wage.

In the short run, consumers confuse general cost shocks, common to all firms in the industry, with firm-specific shocks. In the case of a general cost increase, this promotes an excessive propensity to search, restraining the amount by which prices increase in the short run. Conversely, in the case of an idiosyncratic cost increase, consumers search too little, causing the prices of high-cost firms to overshoot.

ID EXISTENCE
AB Existence of equilibrium with incomplete markets is problematic because demand functions are typically not continuous. Discontinuities occur at prices for which a marketed asset suddenly becomes redundant. We show that this discontinuity disappears if we allow an agent in the economy to introduce a new asset when such redundancies occur. This enables us to prove existence with incomplete markets using a standard path-following argument. Hence, available algorithms for path-following in R(K) can be applied to compute equilibria in the GEI case. We demonstrate this by computing equilibrium for a numerical example.

ID EXCHANGE ECONOMY; MECHANISMS
AB In the previous paper Keisler (1995) we introduced a random price adjustment model for an exchange economy which is decentralized in that the trades permitted to an agent and the resulting price changes depend only on the commodity vector currently held by that agent, and not on the whole economy. Our model is an exchange economy with a finite set of commodities, a market maker who adjusts prices, a large finite set of agents who trade only with the market maker, and a parameter lambda is an element of (0, 1) which determines the rate of price adjustment. Each agent has an initial endowment and a preference relation. At each discrete time, one agent is chosen at random and makes the trade which maximizes his preferences subject to the budget constraint at the current price vector. Then the market maker adjusts the price vector according to the following rule: if x is the change in the commodity vector of the agent who just traded, p is the old price, and alpha is the number of agents, then the new price is p + (alpha(-lambda))x. Thus both the price vector and the commodity allocation change randomly with time.
   We obtain asymptotic results as the number of agents goes to infinity, subject to stability assumptions on the price paths. It was shown in the earlier paper that with probability arbitrarily close to one the price path in our model will approximate the price path of the corresponding tatonnement process on a rapid time scale, and will then remain close to a limit price. In this paper we show that, with probability arbitrarily close to one, the economy will approach a competitive equilibrium, and the process will be feasible in the sense that the market maker's inventory is approximately constant over time. Our main assumption is that the price adjustment rule is stable throughout the trading process. This is stronger than the classical tatonnement assumption that the price adjustment rule is stable at the initial endowment. We show that many classical examples of exchange economies satisfy our assumptions, and then give an example where stability at the initial endowment holds but the stronger stability assumption needed for our results fails.

This paper explores one way in which this assumption can be relaxed in the context of the multiproduct nonlinear pricing problem. It is shown that the firm will choose to exclude some low value consumers from all markets. A class of cases that allow explicit solution is derived by making use of a multivariate form of ''integration by parts.'' In such cases the optimal tariff is cost-based.

ID UNEQUAL INEQUALITIES
AB Inequality measures are often used to summarize information about empirical income distributions. However the resulting picture of the distribution and of changes in the distribution can be severely distorted if the data are contaminated. The nature of this distortion will in general depend upon the underlying properties of the inequality measure. We investigate this issue theoretically using a technique based on the influence function, and illustrate the magnitude of the effect using a simulation. We consider both direct nonparametric estimation from the sample, and indirect estimation using a parametric model; in the latter case we demonstrate the application of a robust estimation procedure. We apply our results to two micro-data examples.

It is not assumed that Lambda and F belong to known parametric families; they are estimated nonparametrically. This model generalizes a large number of widely used models that make stronger a priori assumptions about Lambda and/or F. The paper develops n(1/2)-consistent, asymptotically normal estimators of Lambda, F, and quantiles of the conditional distribution of Y. Estimators of beta that are n(1/2)-consistent and asymptotically normal already exist. The results of Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the new estimators work reasonably well in samples of size 100.

AB It is widely known that conditional covariances of asset returns change over time. Researchers doing empirical work have adopted many strategies for accommodating conditional heteroskedasticity. Among the popular strategies are: (a) chopping the available data into short blocks of time and assuming homoskedasticity within the blocks, (b) performing one-sided rolling regressions, in which only data from, say, the preceding five year period is used to estimate the conditional covariance of returns at a given date, and (c) performing two-sided rolling regressions, in which covariances are estimated for each date using, say, five years of lags and five years of leads. Another model-GARCH-amounts to a one-sided weighted rolling regression. We develop continuous record asymptotic approximations for the measurement error in conditional variances and covariances when using these methods. We derive asymptotically optimal window lengths for standard rolling regressions and optimal weights for weighted rolling regressions. As an empirical example, we estimate volatility on the S&P 500 stock index using daily data from 1928 to 1990.

AB We investigate the separate effects of a training program on the duration of participants' subsequent employment and unemployment spells. This program randomly assigned volunteers to treatment and control groups. However, the treatments and controls experiencing subsequent employment and unemployment spells are not generally random (or comparable) subsets of the initial groups because the sorting process into subsequent spells is very different for the two groups. Standard practice in duration models ignores this sorting process, leading to a sample selection problem and misleading estimates of the training effects. We propose an estimator that addresses this problem and find that the program studied, the National Supported Work Demonstration, raised trainees' employment rates solely by lengthening their employment durations.

AB Evolutionary game theory informs the design and analysis of 26 experimental sessions using normal form games with 6-24: players. The state typically converges to the subset of Nash equilibria called evolutionary equilibria, especially under conditions of mean matching and history. Mixed strategy equilibria are explained better by 'purification' strategies than by homogenous independent individual randomisation. The risk dominance criterion fares poorly in some coordination game environments. With small player populations and large gains to cooperative behaviour, some players apparently attempt to influence other players' actions, contrary to a key theoretical assumption.

ID FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RISK
AB The difference between data used in empirical studies and that envisioned in the theory can influence empirical estimates, sometimes by enough that the direction of future research is altered. This paper illustrates how, in the context of tests of forward rate unbiasedness, a lack of articulation about the mechanics underlying foreign exchange market speculation and about the institutional aspects governing spot and forward rate contracts leads to sampling of the data in a way that is not consistent with the theory. We find that the sampling problems account for some, but not all of the bias in the coefficient on the forward premium.

TI The role of informal finance in household capital accumulation: Evidence
   from Taiwan
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Economies that experience rapid growth also experience major changes in their consumption patterns, particularly for consumer durables. This paper studies the diffusion of durables in Taiwan between 1977 and 1991. We focus on the link between household accumulation of durables and participation in informal financial institutions. While growth in per capita income in Taiwan has been great, many households still rely on traditional forms of finance. We test the idea that rotating savings and credit associations, which are found worldwide, exist to lower the cost of saving for durables. Our analysis finds evidence of that link.

AB This paper investigates the extent to which the supply of collateral affects business formation in the UK. Bank loans are typically secured on the entrepreneur's house. Using a variety of data and formulations, evidence is found that a 10% rise in the value of unreleased net housing equity increases the number of new VAT registrations by some 5%. Since we find that businesses formed in response to increases in the value of housing assets seem to be of at least average quality as measured by survival chances, there appears to be a large pool of untapped entrepreneurial talent.

ID MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; SPATIAL COMPETITION; ENTRY
AB We re-examine the economic justification for the regulation of firms' price policies. Existing analysis of the relative benefits of alternative pricing policies, by treating market structure as exogenous, loses an important trade-off Price deregulation leading to, for example, discriminatory pricing, on the one hand, enhances competition between incumbents but, on the other, acts as a strong deterrent against entry. We illustrate this trade-off by analysing the familiar address model of product differentiation and show that product variety is determined by the degree of spatial contestability of the market (the ability of entrants to make binding location commitments) and by whether firms are free to price discriminate.

ID SOCIAL NORMS; DISCRIMINATION
AB The paper is a first attempt at modelling the idea of group reputation as an aggregate of individual reputations. A member's current incentives are affected by his past behaviour and, because his track record is observed only with noise, by the group's past behaviour as well. The paper thus studies the joint dynamics of individual and collective reputations and derives the existence of stereotypes from history dependence rather than from a multiplicity of equilibria or from the existence of a common trait as is usually done in the literature. It shows that new members of an organization may suffer from an original sin of their elders long after the latter are gone, and it derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which group reputations can be rebuilt. Last, the paper applies the theory to analyse when a large firm can maintain a reputation for quality.

For other solution concepts, such as the iterative removal of weakly dominated strategies, undominated Nash equilibrium, and maximin, it is possible to implement non-dictatorial social choice functions. Which aspects of solution concepts accounts for these differences? We answer this question by providing a characterization of solution concepts which lead to impossibility results.

DT Article
ID RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS EQUILIBRIUM; GENERIC EXISTENCE; COMMON KNOWLEDGE;
   MARKETS; INFORMATION; GAMES; PRICES
AB This paper compares the performance of a decentralized market with that of a dealership market when traders have differential information. Trade occurs as a result of equilibrium actions in a Bayesian game, where uncertainty is captured by a finite state space and information is represented by partitions on this space. In the benchmark case of trade with common knowledge of endowments, the two mechanisms deliver virtually identical outcomes. However, with differential information, the dealership market has strictly higher trading volume, and yields an efficient post-trade allocation in most states. In contrast, the decentralized market suffers from suboptimal trading volume. The reason for this poor performance is the vulnerability of the decentralized market to higher-order uncertainty concerning the fundamentals of the market. Traders may know that mutually beneficial trade is feasible, and perhaps know that they know, and yet a failure of common knowledge that this is so precludes efficient trade. The dealership market is robust to this type of uncertainty.

DT Article
ID OLIGOPOLISTIC INDUSTRIES; EXPORT SUBSIDIES; INCENTIVES
AB This paper examines strategic trade policy under asymmetric information with publicly observable contracts. We analyse both the cases of unilateral and bilateral intervention. We find that the requirement of incentive compatibility undermines the strategic precommitment effect when public funds are costly, even with no restrictions on the form of the policies. Second, when firms sell substitute goods, the introduction of a rival interventionist government may reduce the cost of informational rents to each government. Third, it turns out that under bilateral intervention there exists a continuum of symmetric equilibria with levels of output and corresponding levels of welfare in the exporting countries which can be ranked. The requirement of ex post participation constraints for the firm limits the set of subsidies which can be offered to the firm. In particular, under bilateral intervention, the equilibrium levels of output which are implemented under adverse selection are below their values under ex ante uncertainty, i.e., below the equilibrium levels of output which are achieved when firms sign their contracts before the realization of their costs.

The index is a general equilibrium application of the distance function and answers the question: ''What uniform set of trade restrictions is equivalent (in welfare terms) to the initial protective structure?'' The index is applicable to both tariffs and quotas and permits international and intertemporal comparisons. The index is operational and we provide two empirical examples to illustrate its applicability and to show its superiority to commonly used measures.

TI Interaction between endogenous human capital and technological change
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English

ID GROWTH; DEMAND; MODEL; WAGES
AB This paper examines how interaction between endogenous human capital accumulation and technological change affects relative wages and economic growth. Private incentives to invest in human capital finance the employment of skilled labour in the education sector, while non-rival technology is a by-product of the education process. The absorption of new technologies into production is skill intensive, creates skill-biased labour demand, and increases the relative wage of skilled to unskilled labour. In contrast to recent models of endogenous growth, higher rates of technological change and growth may be accompanied by a higher relative wage but lower relative supply of skilled labour. Thus the model provides a theoretical foundation for the empirically observed relation between technological change and relative demand, supply and wages of skilled labour.

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMAL RATES; HETEROSCEDASTICITY; CONVERGENCE; TESTS
AB Linear models with error components are widely used to analyse panel data. Some applications of these models require knowledge of the probability densities of the error components. Existing methods handle this requirement by assuming that the densities belong to known parametric families of distributions (typically the normal distribution). This paper shows how to carry out nonparametric estimation of the densities of the error components, thereby avoiding the assumption that the densities belong to known parametric families. The nonparametric estimators are applied to an earnings model using data from the Current Population Survey. The model's transitory error component is not normally distributed. Use of the nonparametric density estimators yields estimates of the probability that individuals with row earnings will become high earners in the future that are much lower than the estimates obtained under the assumption of normally distributed error components.

ID THEOREM; TESTS
AB The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theorem, which predicts that countries will export products that ave made from factors in great supply, performs poorly. However, deviations from HOV follow pronounced patterns. Trade is missing relative to its HOV prediction. Also, rich countries appear scarce in most factors and poor countries appear abundant in all factors, a fact that squares poorly with the HOV prediction that abundant factors are exported. As suggested by the patterns, HOV is rejected empirically in favor of a modification that allows for home bias in consumption and international technology differences.

ID CONTRACTS
AB A countertrade contract ties an export to an import. Usually, countertrade is criticized as a form of bilateralism and reciprocity and thus as an inefficient form of international exchange. In this paper we argue that there are circumstances in which the tying of two technologically unrelated trade flows may be efficiency-enhancing. We show that countertrade can be an efficient institution in international trade that solves moral-hazard problems and restores creditworthiness of highly indebted countries. We test the implications of our model using a sample of 230 countertrade contracts.

AB I use micro data from the Labor Force Surveys conducted in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during 1981-1991 to show that during 1981-1987 wage differences between schooling groups fell by well over one-half This sharp reduction is associated with large increases in the size of the educated Palestinian labor force, Since the returns to schooling for Israeli Jews were stable, the decline in returns to schooling for Palestinians is consistent with the notion that the returns to schooling in the territories were determined largely by the forces of supply and demand in a segmented market for skilled labor.

AB This study analyzes the extent to which mutual funds purchase stocks based on their past returns as well as their tendency to exhibit ''herding'' behavior (i.e., buying and selling the same stocks at the same rime). We find that 77 percent of the mutual funds were ''momentum investors,'' buying stocks that were past winners; however, most did not systematically sell past losers. On average, funds that invested on momentum realized significantly better performance than other funds. We also find relatively weak evidence that funds tended to buy and sell the same stocks at the same time.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

ID MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; FLUCTUATIONS; CAPACITY
AB One way in which corporate financial structure affects macroeconomic performance is by creating debt overhang. Debt overhang occurs when existing debt deters new investment because the benefits from new investment will go to the existing creditors, not to the new investors. If the economy is booming, debt overhang will not bind because the returns to investing are high. If the economy is stagnant, debt overhang will bind because the returns to investing are low. As a result, high levels of debt can create multiple expectational equilibria in which ''animal spirits'' determine economy activity.

The EIS increases with the level of consumption, (iii) The variables that change the EIS are also important in explaining excess sensitivity over the business cycle.

In a sample of 92 countries as well as a sample of OECD countries, we find that countries with higher volatility have lower growth. The addition of standard control variables strengthens the negative relationship. We also find that government spending-induced volatility is negatively associated with growth even after controlling for both time- and country-fixed effects.

AB We investigate the structure of preferences and uncertainty that guarantees that prices are fully revealing even though asset markers are incomplete and there are more sources of uncertainty than assets in the economy. A sufficient condition for fully revealing prices is that investors have preferences of the (possibly state-dependent) linear-risk-tolerance class. Finally, we discuss how our result allows one to extend certain existing literature on demand aggregation, welfare analysis, and the pricing of contingent claims to the case in which markets are incomplete and investors have asymmetric private information.

We present a simple strategic setting in which this paradox is a general phenomenon. However the paradox disappears when there is noisy observation of the players' actions, and the aggregate level of noise does not disappear too rapidly as the number of players increases. We give several economic examples in which this paradox has recently received attention: durable-goods monopoly, corporate takeovers, and time consistency of optimal government policy.

A model of a potentially judgment-proof owner of a firm, a lender, and a potential victim is developed in which this policy can increase accident frequency and reduce efficiency. Full, partial, and zero lender-liability rules and a minimum equity requirement are analyzed. Partial lender liability and an equivalent minimum equity requirement deliver the highest level of efficiency, although the former can deliver a higher contribution by the lender to the victim than the latter.

The firm first engages in R&D to affect the safety of its product, Since the outcome of R&D trials is unobservable to consumers, the firm then chooses its price, understanding that consumers may draw inferences from the price about the product's safety. Consumers acquire and use the product; injuries lend to losses which are allocated by the liability system. We vary the liability system's allocation of losses and trace out the implications for R&D investment and the price-safety relationship.

Geography imposes a particular institutional structure of local governments due to the overlapping of market areas associated with different LPG's, The optimum can be decentralized through local governments that have jurisdiction over market areas of all LPG types. This implies that the appropriate suppliers of LPG's are metropolitan governments which finance them through user charges and land rent. in addition, our approach invalidates the prevailing theory of fiscal federalism, according to which a layer of government should be established for each type of LPG.

AB In this paper we show that some of the predictions of models of consumer intertemporal optimization are in line with the patterns of nondurable expenditure observed in U.S. household-level data. We propose a flexible specification of preferences that allows multiple commodities and yields empirically tractable equations. We estimate preference parameters using the only U.S. micro data set with complete consumption information. We show that previous rejections can be explained by the simplifying assumptions made in previous studies. We also show that results obtained using good consumption or aggregate data can be misleading.

AB For a wide class of infinitely lived agent models, Chamley has shown that the optimal capital income tax rate is zero in the long run. Lucas has argued that for the U.S. economy, there is a significant welfare gain from switching to this policy. This paper shows that for the Bewley class of models with incomplete insurance markets and borrowing constraints, the optimal tax rate on capital income is positive, even in the long run. Therefore, cutting the capital income tax to zero may well lead to welfare losses.

The estimates indicate that (i) imperfect knowledge about the management of the new seeds was a significant barrier to adoption; (ii) this barrier diminished as farmer experience with the new technologies increased; (iii) own experience and neighbors' experience with HYVs significantly increased HYV profitability; and (iv) farmers do not fully incorporate the village returns to learning in making adoption decisions.

AB An important question in political economy concerns the form of transfers to special interests. The Chicago view is that political competition leads politicians to make such transfers efficiently. The Virginia position is that lack of information on the part of voters leads politicians to favor inefficient ''sneaky'' methods of redistribution. This paper analyzes the form of transfers in a model of political competition in which politicians have incentives to make transfers to special interests. It shows that when voters have imperfect information about both the effects of policy and the predispositions of politicians, inefficient methods of redistribution may be employed.

In this paper, limitations of previous attempts to test the efficient redistribution hypothesis are discussed, and an alternative test of the efficient redistribution hypothesis that uses vector optimization theory and bootstrap methodology is presented.

AB This paper develops a general equilibrium model of the allocation of resources among appropriative and productive activities. The model emphasizes the distinction between offensive weapons, which are the instruments of predation, and fortifications, which provide defense against predation. The analysis of this model shows how the equilibrium security of claims to property is determined. The analysis focuses on the possibility of a nonaggressive equilibrium, in which no resources are allocated to offensive weapons and claims to property are fully secure. We also analyze the complex relation between economic welfare and the security of claims to property. We find, for example, that a relatively poor agent could be better off in an equilibrium with less secure claims to property.

ID CONVERGENCE
AB This paper examines the extent to which patterns of human capital convergence can account for observed patterns of income inequality between countries. To do this I decompose national income into three components: one due to education levels, one reflecting the return to education, and a residual component. I then examine in turn the contribution of each of them to changes in income dispersion. Among the developed countries, convergence in education levels has resulted in a reduction in income dispersion. However, for the world as a whole, incomes have diverged despite substantial convergence in education levels. This is a result of increases in the return to education that favor the developed countries at the expense of the less developed countries.

AB This paper examines the congressional passage of the American minimum wage law, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Voting on the act is modeled as a function of the concentration of the constituencies for minimum wage legislation, North-South differentials, and legislator ideology. It is shown that the House radically altered the final content of the bill, abandoning a proposed Wages and Hours Board with discretionary powers to determine minimum wages in favor of a flat rate following the objections of several interest groups; North-South divisions over the bill had little influence over congressional voting; and the influence of constituent groups increased relative to legislators' ideology as the bill became an important election issue.

AB To accommodate the observed pattern of risk-aversion and risk-seeking, as well as common violations of expected utility (e.g., the certainty effect), we introduce and characterize a weighting function according to which an event has greater impact when it turns impossibility into possibility, or possibility into certainty, than when it merely makes a possibility more or less likely. We show how to compare such weighting functions (of different individuals) with respect to the degree of departure from expected utility, and we present a method for comparing an individual's weighting functions for risk and for uncertainty.

AB This paper considers the theory of market versus optimal product diversity in the light of two recent advances in oligopoly theory. The first is the development of discrete choice models to describe heterogeneous consumer tastes, and the application of such models to oligopolistic competition. The second advance is the proof that logconcavity of the consumer taste density guarantees the existence of a price equilibrium. We analyze an oligopoly model with price competition and free entry, taking explicit account of the integer constraint. Under the Chamberlinian symmetry assumption (that tastes are i.i.d.), we first show that logconcavity of the taste density implies there is excessive market provision of variety when each consumer buys one unit of the product from one of the firms. We then show that this result extends to price-sensitive individual demands by proving that the equilibrium number of firms is at least as great as that which would be provided at the second-best social optimum subject to a zero-profit constraint for firms. Our results call into question previous findings for representative consumer models that left open the possibility of insufficient product diversity.

DE SOCIAL EVALUATION; POPULATION ETHICS; CRITICAL-LEVEL UTILITARIANISM
ID SOCIAL CRITERIA; CHOICE; SIZE; EQUITY
AB This paper considers the problem of social evaluation in a model where population size, individual lifetime utilities, lengths of life, and birth dates vary across states. In an intertemporal framework, we investigate principles for social evaluation that allow history to matter to some extent. Using an axiom called independence of the utilities of the dead, we provide a characterization of critical-level generalized utilitarian rules. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that social discounting is ruled out in an intertemporal welfarist environment. A simple population-planning example is also discussed.

AB A common interest game is a game in which there exists a unique pair of payoffs which strictly Pareto-dominates all other payoffs. We consider the undiscounted repeated game obtained by the infinite repetition of such a two-player stage game. We show that if supergame strategies are restricted to be computable within Church's thesis, the only pair of payoffs which survives any computable tremble with sufficiently large support is the Pareto-efficient pair. The result is driven by the ability of the players to use the early stages of the game to communicate their intention to play cooperatively in the future.

AB This paper investigates stability properties of evolutionary selection dynamics in normal-form games. The analysis is focused on deterministic dynamics in continuous time and on asymptotic stability of sets of population states, more precisely of faces of the mixed-strategy space. The main result is a characterization of those faces which are asymptotically stable in all dynamics from a certain class, and we show that every such face contains an essential component of the set of Nash equilibria, and hence a strategically stable set in the sense of Kohlberg and Mertens (1986).

ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB Two-person repeated games with no discounting are considered where there is uncertainty about the type of the players. If there is a possibility that a player is an automaton committed to a particular pure or mixed stage-game action, then this provides a lower bound on the Nash equilibrium payoffs to a normal type of this player. The lower bound is the best available and is robust to the existence of other types. The results are extended to the case of two-sided uncertainty. This work extends Schmidt (1993) who analyzed the restricted class of conflicting interest games.

AB We present three distinct approaches to perfect and proper equilibria for infinite normal form games. In the first two approaches, players ''tremble'' in the infinite games playing full support approximate best responses to others' strategies. In the strong approach, a tremble assigns high probability to the set of pure best responses; in the weak approach, it assigns high probability to a neighborhood of this set. The third, limit-of-finite approach applies traditional refinements to sequences of successively larger finite games. Overall, the strong approach to equilibrium refinement most fully respects the structure of infinite games.

AB We apply nonparametric regression models to estimation of demand curves of the type most often used in applied research. From the demand curve estimators we derive estimates of exact consumers surplus and deadweight loss, which are the most widely used welfare and economic efficiency measures in areas of economics such as public finance. We also develop tests of the symmetry and downward sloping properties of compensated demand. We work out asymptotic normal sampling theory for kernel and series nonparametric estimators, as well as for the parametric case.
   The paper includes an application to gasoline demand. Empirical questions of interest here are the shape of the demand curve and the average magnitude of welfare loss from a tax on gasoline. In this application we compare parametric and nonparametric estimates of the demand curve, calculate exact and approximate measures of consumers surplus and deadweight loss, and give standard error estimates. We also analyze the sensitivity of the welfare measures to components of nonparametric regression estimators such as the number of terms in a series approximation.

AB In order to increase their electoral chances, incumbents may forego policy measures that improve the relative standing of their opponents in the eyes of voters. This paper illustrates the point by focusing on the choice between fixed and floating exchange rates. An inflation-averse government may refrain from choosing fixed exchange rates in order to capitalise on the 'inflationary' reputation of its opponent. This incentive is contrasted with the opposite incentive to 'tie the hands' of its opponent should the latter win the election. For a more inflationary government, electoral considerations reinforce the incentive to 'tie its own hands' with fixed exchange rates.

In particular, it measures the Expected Utility Model (EUM) with linear and nonlinear objective probabilities; the EUM with linear and nonlinear subjective probabilities. The econometric analysis indicates that the decision making model is under uncertainty and that people work out their subjective probabilities through their past experiences. Finally, agents in the sample turn out to be risk-averse and not to have a positive reservation wage.

We find that the correlation between poverty and size vanishes in Pakistan when the size elasticity of the cost of living is about 0.6. This turns out to be the elasticity implied by a modified version of the food share method of setting scales. By contrast, some measures of child nutritional status indicate an elasticity of unify. Consideration of the weight attached to child versus adult welfare may help resolve the non-robustness of demographic profiles of poverty.

Using a simple model of imperfect competition between multi-product banks, the paper evaluates two proposals which have been raised in this context: spinning off entire divisions versus splitting the banks into smaller banks. The degree of substitutability between banking products (e.g. short-and long-term credit) plays a key role in the analysis. Implications for banking reform in other countries are briefly discussed.

AB Traditional analysis of the impact of competitive tendering on service provision has focused on costs and prices. Critics have argued that price reductions lead to lower quality. We tested this hypothesis using a two equation econometric model, with data from a panel of 61 cleaning services contracts. The results indicated that while competition reduced price significantly, quality of service was maintained or even enhanced. The effect of competition turned out to be greater on prices than on quality, and the influence of ownership appeared to be negligible on both. The evidence does not support the hypothesis that efficiency gains are traded off for lower quality.

A whole range of alternative hypotheses regarding price determination in the forward market is examined for the $/DM case, including different expectations schemes, a risk premium model derived from international asset pricing theory and the novel idea that the empirical evidence on the FMEH is the result of intervention by monetary authorities. The latter hypothesis as well as the hypothesis that expectations are formed in a static manner rather than rational appear to work the best.

Goods trade alone will not equalise factor prices, so there is an incentive for factors to move internationally. We characterise equilibria in which there is no trade, goods trade only, factor movement only, and both trade in goods and factor movement. This generalises the Heckscher-Ohlin model to explain not only the direction of trade, but also the prior question of what gets traded, i.e. how goods and factors are partitioned into tradeables and non-tradeables.

AB A large theoretical literature has emerged directed at explaining the presence of intra-industry trade (IIT). One of the distinctions which comes out of these models is that between horizontal IIT (where goods are differentiated by attributes) and vertical IIT (where goods are differentiated by quality). In this paper horizontal and vertical IIT in UK trade are disentangled using a unit value dispersion criterion and a range of industry characteristics. The paper not only points up the relative importance of vertical and horizontal IIT in the United Kingdom, it also demonstrates how a failure to separate them out can impact on the interpretation of empirical results.

AB A monopolistically competitive manufacturing sector produces goods used for final consumption and as intermediates. Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for manufacturing agglomeration. How does globalization affect the location of manufacturing and gains from trade? At high transport costs all countries have some manufacturing, but when transport costs fall below a critical value, a core-periphery spontaneously forms, and nations that find themselves in the periphery suffer a decline in real income. At still lower transport costs there is convergence of real incomes, in which peripheral nations gain and core nations may lose.

Regional specialization in the United States rose substantially between 1860 and the turn of the twentieth century, flattened out during the interwar years, and then fell substantially and continuously since the 1930s. The analysis of the long-run trends in U.S. regional specialization and localization supports explanations based on production scale economies and the Heckscher-Ohlin model but is inconsistent with explanations based on external economies.

These targeted expansions severed the historical tie between AFDC and Medicaid eligibility. The reforms allowed a mother's earnings to increase without losing public health insurance for her young children. Increasing the income Limit for Medicaid resulted in a decrease in AFDC participation and an increase in labor force participation among these women. The effects were large for ever married women, and negligible for never married women.

AB In this paper, we consider two measures of the relative effectiveness of public and Catholic schools: finishing high school and starting college. These measures are potentially more important indicators of school quality than standardized test scores in light of the economic consequences of obtaining more education. Single-equation estimates suggest that for the typical student, attending a Catholic high school raises the probability of finishing high school or entering a four-year college by thirteen percentage points. In bivariate probit models we find almost no evidence that our single-equation estimates are subject to selection bias.

AB This paper investigates the effects of shocks to U.S. monetary policy on exchange rates. We consider three measures of these shocks: orthogonalized shocks to the federal funds rate, orthogonalized shocks to the ratio of nonborrowed to total reserves and changes in the Romer and Romer index of monetary policy. In sharp contrast to the literature, we find substantial evidence of a link between monetary policy and exchange rates. Specifically, according to our results a contractionary shock to U.S. monetary policy leads to (i) persistent, significant appreciations in U.S. nominal and real exchange rates and (ii) significant, persistent deviations hom uncovered interest rate parity in favor of U.S. interest rates.

Various key features are then modeled in an abstract but realistic way, either with a full-information risk-sharing model or an information-constrained version of the same model. Observations from some of the villages seem consistent with one or the other of these models, but in many of the villages one is left with risk-response variations across households which suggest that Pareto improvements are possible.

AB This paper studies the determinants of the value of voting rights in U.S. corporations. Results support the hypothesis that the price of a vote is determined by the expected additional payment vote holders will receive for their votes in case of a control contest. The size of this differential payment is a function of the probability that a vote is pivotal in a control contest and the magnitude of the private benefits obtainable by controlling the company. Simple proxies for these two factors explain up to 30 percent of the variation of the voting premium across companies and through time. My findings also suggest that the value of managerial perquisites are, at least partially, reflected in the price of votes.

The empirical evidence indicates that employment changes in a small group of trade-impacted concentrated industries can explain not only part of the aggregate rise in wage inequality in the United States, but also some of the differences in the trends in wage inequality across metropolitan areas.

AB A panel data approach is advocated and implemented for studying growth convergence. The familiar equation for testing convergence is reformulated as a dynamic panel data model, and different panel data estimators are used to estimate it. The main usefulness of the panel approach lies in its ability to allow for differences in the aggregate production function across economies. This leads to results that are significantly different from those obtained from single cross-country regressions. In the process of identifying the individual ''country effect,'' we can also see the point where neoclassical growth empirics meets development economics.

AB Polygyny is still practiced throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, with important social consequences. This paper makes the first attempt to link African polygyny directly to the productivity of women in agriculture using micro data. I develop a structural model of the demand for wives that disentangles wealth and substitution effects. Using a large household survey from Cote d'Ivoire, I find that marked geographic diversity in cropping patterns leads to regional variation in female labor productivity. I also find that, conditional on wealth, men do have more wives when women are more productive, that is, cheaper. This substitution effect may explain why polygyny declined in rural areas of Cote d'Ivoire during agricultural development.

AB This paper investigates the claim, often put forth by real business cycle proponents, that the poor performance of their models in matching real-world aggregate labor market behavior is due to the fact that observed real wage payments do not correspond to the actual marginal productivity of labor but contain an insurance component that cannot be accounted for by the Walrasian pricing mechanism. To test this idea, we dispense with the Walrasian description of the labor market and introduce contractual arrangements between employees and employers. Assuming that employees are prevented from accessing capital markets and are more risk averse than employers, we use the theory of optimal contracts to derive an equilibrium relation between aggregate states of the economy and wage-labor outcomes. This contractual arrangement is then embedded into a standard one-sector, stochastic neoclassical growth model in order to look at the business cycle implications of the contractual hypothesis. The resulting dynamic equilibrium relations are then parameterized and studied by means of standard numerical approximation techniques. The quantitative properties of our model appear to be somewhat encouraging. We have examined different contractual environments, and in all circumstances the contracts-based equilibrium performs better than standard ones with regard to the labor market variables and at least as well with regard to the other aggregate macroeconomic variables. The present paper reports only the simulation results relative to what we consider the most empirically relevant cases.

AB This paper develops a model of small business failure and sale that is motivated by recent evidence concerning how the failure and sale of small businesses vary with the age of the business and the tenure of the manager. This evidence motivates two key features of the model: a match between the manager and the business, and characteristics of businesses that survive beyond the current match. The parameters of the model are estimated, and the properties of this parametric model are studied. This analysis results in a simple characterization of the workings of the small business sector.

AB This paper presents a model in which agents choose an action and a time at which to take the action. We show that when agents choose when to act, their decisions become clustered together, giving the appearance of an information cascade, even though information is actually being used efficiently. This occurs because the passage of time allows the first acting agent to anticipate something about the second agent's information, and for a large class of delay cost functions, the equilibrium orders agents in such a way that the most extreme information is revealed first.

ID GROWTH
AB This paper uses data for eight manufacturing industries in 1970 and 1987 to test for and characterize dynamic production externalities in cities. We find evidence of both MAR externalities, which are associated with past own industry employment concentration, and Jacobs externalities, which are associated with past diversity of local total employment. More specifically, for mature capital goods industries, there is evidence of MAR externalities but none of Jacobs externalities. For new high-tech industries, there is evidence of Jacobs and MAR externalities. These findings are consistent with notions of urban specialization and product cycles: new industries prosper in large, diverse metropolitan areas, but with maturity, production decentralizes to smaller, more specialized cities. For mature industries, there is also a high degree of persistence in individual employment patterns across cities, fostered by both MAR externalities and persistence in regional comparative advantage.

AB This paper examines the argument presented in The Bell Curve. A central argument is that one factor-g-accounts for correlation across test scores and performance in society. Another central argument is that g cannot be manipulated. These arguments are combined to claim that social policies designed to improve social performance cannot be effective. A reanalysis of the evidence contradicts this story. The factors that explain wages receive different weights than the factors that explain test scores. More than g is required to explain either. Other factors besides g contribute to social performance, and they can be manipulated.

AB We survey recent work on competition in markets in which consumers have costs of switching between competing firms' products. In a market with switching costs (or ''brand loyalty''), a firm's current market share is an important determinant of its future profitability. We examine how the firm's choice between setting a low price to capture market share, and setting a high price to harvest profits by exploiting its current locked-in customers, is affected by the threat of new entry, interest rates, exchange rate expectations, the state of the business cycle, etc. We also discuss the causes of switching costs; explain introductory offers and price wars; examine industry profits; and analyse firms' product choices. Moreover, we argue that switching costs between suppliers help explain both the existance of multi-product firms and the nature of competition between such firms.

ID INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; IMPERFECT INFORMATION; INSURANCE MARKETS; MODEL
AB We study a credit model where, because of adverse selection, unprofitable projects may nevertheless be financed. Indeed they may continue to be financed even when shown to be low-quality if sunk costs have already been incurred. We show that credit decentralization offers a way for creditors to commit riot to refinance such projects, thereby discouraging entrepreneurs from undertaking them initially. Thus, decentralization provides financial discipline. Nevertheless, we argue that it puts too high a premium on short-term returns.
   The model seems pertinent to two issues: ''soft budget constraint'' problems in centralized economies, and differences between ''Anglo-Saxon'' and ''German-Japanese'' financing practices.

AB The paper presents a dynamic contracting model of myopic firm behaviour caused by the fear of early project termination by outside investors. Although the parties can conclude longterm contracts, asymmetric information between investors and firms can make it impossible to implement profitable long-term projects. The paper characterizes the structure of optimal, renegotiation-proof contracts for unmonitored and monitored finance. Monitoring by investors, although itself subject to distorting incentive constraints, is shown to be able to overcome the short-term bias of investment and thus to lengthen the firms' planning horizon.

AB This paper studies a dynamic insurance problem with bilateral asymmetric information and balanced budgets. There are two infinitely-lived agents in our model, both risk averse, and each has an i.i.d. random endowment stream which is unobservable to the other. In each period, each agent must have a non-negative consumption and together they must consume the entire aggregate endowment. Dynamic incentive compatibility in the Nash sense is defined. We give sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a constrained efficient contract. We show that a constrained efficient contract can be characterized in a Bellman equation. We demonstrate that the long-run distribution of expected utilities of each agent is not degenerate. We also develop an algorithm for computing the efficient contract and, in a numerical example, we find that the consumption processes of the agents form stationary Markov chains.

AB This paper considers a representative agent model of asset prices based on a recursive utility specification. A constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution is assumed but the risk-preference component of utility is restricted only by qualitative, non-parametric regularity conditions. A principal contribution is to determine the exhaustive implications of this semiparametric recursive utility model for the one-step ahead joint probability distribution for consumption growth and asset returns. It is also shown, in contrast to the claims of previous studies, that the generalization from expected utility to recursive utility contributes substantially to the resolution of the equity premium puzzle.

AB Externalities between buyers are shown to induce delays in negotiations between a seller and several buyers. Delays arise in a perfect and complete information setting with random matching even when there is no deadline. While with a deadline we identify delays both for positive and negative externalities, without a deadline we find that (1) when externalities are positive, there exists no SPNE in pure strategies with bounded recall that exhibits delay; (2) when externalities are negative, it may happen that all SPNE with bounded recall have the property that long periods of waiting alternate with short periods of activity: This is the cyclical delay phenomenon.

AB We introduce a new model for time-varying conditional variances as the most general quadratic version possible within the ARCH class. Hence, it encompasses all the existing restricted quadratic variance functions. Its properties are very similar to those of GARCH models, but avoids some of their criticisms. In univariate applications to daily U.S. and monthly U.K. stock market returns, QARCH adequately represents volatility and risk premia. QARCH is easy to incorporate in multivariate models to capture dynamic asymmetries that GARCH rules out. Such asymmetries are found in an empirical application of a conditional factor model to 26 U.K. sectorial stock returns.

Central bankers intervene with greater intensity as rates deviate from target levels, but they also try to stabilize rates around current levels. The model is estimated using exchange rates and data based upon observed central-bank interventions. Interestingly, the estimates of the model are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model for both the deutsche-mark/dollar rate and, less strongly, for the yen/dollar rate.

We focus on the implications for policy design of the absence of efficient capital markets, on the welfare costs of reforming gradually, on incentive problems created by trade adjustment policies, and on the redistributive aspects of policy reform-all transitional problems that arise in most economic reforms. A key consideration is that adjustment should focus on increasing the value of the assets owned by the groups affected, and not on direct income transfers or programs targeted on characteristics controlled by the beneficiaries.

Of primary importance here is the distinction between permanent and temporary protection on the one hand, and between tariffs and quotas on the other. We find that a permanent tariff speeds up adoption, but a permanent quota delays adoption unless the quota is highly restrictive. However, temporary protection (i.e., protection that remains effective until the firm adopts new technology) always delays the timing of technology adoption.

ID WELFARE DOMINANCE; TAXATION; INEQUALITY; EQUITY
AB A tax reform is ''Dalton-improving'' if it improves social welfare for all possible social-welfare functions that conform to Dalton's principle of transfers. According to this principle, there exists a prior social ranking of households, and a transfer is approved if it distributes from high-ranking (''rich'') to low-ranking (''poor'') households, without altering the ranking itself. In this paper we develop a procedure for identifying marginal Dalton-improving reforms in the context of indirect taxation. The methodology is illustrated using data on excise taxes in the United Kingdom.

AB The First Theorem of Welfare Economics rests on the assumption that individuals have neither price-making nor market-making capacities. We offer a revision in which individuals have such capacities. The revision emphasizes two keys for market efficiency: (i) the need to align private rewards with social contributions- called full appropriation and (ii) the need for an assumption to counter the possibility of coordination failures in the choice of produced commodities - called noncomplementarity. We also emphasize that information about prices of unmarketed commodities involves decentralized knowledge available only to product innovators and that pecuniary externalities are important potential sources of market failure.

AB The frequency of foreign conflict initiations in the United States is found to be significantly greater following the onset of recessions during a president's first term than in other periods. We develop an economic theory of the political use of wars which links the election cycle, war decisions, and economic performance consistent with the observed relationships among these events. An incumbent leader with an unfavorable economic performance record may initiate a war to force the learning of his war leadership abilities and thus salvage, with some probability, his reelection. This obtains despite voter rationality and informational symmetry.

AB Privatization shifts residual income and control to private investors, restricting redistribution and improving incentives; thus rapid privatization should be desirable. Empirically, however, the transfer of ownership, as opposed to control, is very gradual. I offer an explanation based on investors' concern about future interference. A government averse to redistribution retains a passive stake in the firm; the willingness to bear residual risk signals commitment. When a large government stake conflicts with the transfer of control, underpricing may be necessary for separation. Finally, when the required discount is large, a committed government may prefer not to signal, gaining credibility over time.

If it is possible to commit for at least three periods into the future, then for any feasible consumption plan, there is a perturbation that is majority-preferred to it. Furthermore, plans that minimize the maximum vote that can be obtained against them yield a political business cycle. If it is impossible to commit, voters select the optimal consumption plan for the median voter.

AB Contracting for research is often infeasible because research inputs are unobservable and research outcomes cannot be verified by a court. Sponsoring a research tournament can resolve these problems. A model is presented in which contestants compete to find the innovation of highest value to the tournament sponsor. The winner receives a prespecified prize. The tournament game has a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium. Free entry is not optimal because equilibrium effort by each researcher decreases in the number of contestants. An optimally designed research tournament balances the probability of overshooting the first-best quality level against the probability of falling short.

AB The persistence of cooperation in public-goods experiments has become an important puzzle for economists. This paper presents the first systematic attempt to separate the hypothesis that cooperation is due to kindness, altruism, or warm-glow from the hypothesis that cooperation is simply the result of errors or confusion. The experiment reveals that on average about half of all cooperation comes from subjects who understand free-riding but choose to cooperate out of some form of kindness. This suggests that the focus on errors and ''learning'' in experimental research should shift to include studies of preferences for cooperation as well.

AB The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to conduct annual auctions of emission allowances. Under the discriminative auction rules, sellers with the lowest asking prices receive the highest bids. This paper studies an inverted version of this auction in which buyers face the same incentives as sellers in the EPA auction. Consistent with theoretical predictions, buyers bid above their valuation auction outcomes are inefficient, and increasing the number of buyers increases bids. Buyers facing human opponents compete more aggressively than the risk-neutral prediction, but bids do not differ systematically from this prediction when buyers face computerized Nash ''robots.''

AB Fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) regression was originally designed in work by Phillips and Hansen (1990) to provide optimal estimates of cointegrating regressions. The method modifies least squares to account for serial correlation effects and for the endogeneity in the regressors that results from the existence of a cointegrating relationship. This paper provides a general framework which makes it possible to study the asymptotic behavior of FM-OLS in models with full rank I(1) regressors, models with I(1) and I(0) regressors, models with unit roots, and models with only stationary regressors. This framework enables us to consider the use of FM regression in the context of vector autoregressions (VAR's) with some unit roots and some cointegrating relations. The resulting FM-VAR regressions are shown to have some interesting properties. For example, when there is some cointegration in the system, FM-VAR estimation has a limit theory that is normal for all of the stationary coefficients and mixed normal for all of the nonstationary coefficients. Thus, there are no unit root limit distributions even in the case of the unit root coefficient submatrix (i.e., I-n-r, for an n-dimensional VAR with r cointegrating vectors). Moreover, optimal estimation of the cointegration space is attained in FM-VAR regression without prior knowledge of the number of unit roots in the system, without pretesting to determine the dimension of the cointegration space and without the use of restricted regression techniques like reduced rank regression.
   The paper also develops an asymptotic theory for inference based on FM-OLS and FM-VAR regression. The limit theory for Wald tests that rely on the FM estimator is shown to involve a linear combination of independent chi-squared variates. This limit distribution is bounded above by the conventional chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions. Thus, conventional critical values can be used to construct valid (but conservative) asymptotic tests in quite general FM time series regressions. This theory applies to causality testing in VAR's and is therefore potentially useful in empirical applications.

AB A new asymptotic theory of regression is introduced for possibly nonstationary time series. The regressors are assumed to be generated by a linear process with martingale difference innovations. The conditional variances of these martingale differences are specified as autoregressive stochastic volatility processes, with autoregressive roots which are local to unity.
   We find conditions under which the least squares estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal. A simple adaptive estimator is proposed which achieves the same asymptotic distribution as the generalized least squares estimator, without requiring parametric assumptions for the stochastic volatility process.

   TESTING; FOURIER SERIES; SPECIFICATION TESTING; REGRESSION SPLINES
ID ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY; FUNCTIONAL FORM; MODELS
AB This paper proposes two consistent one-sided specification tests for parametric regression models, one based on the sample covariance between the residual from the parametric model and the discrepancy between the parametric and nonparametric fitted values; the other based on the difference in sums of squared residuals between the parametric and nonparametric models. We estimate the nonparametric model by series regression. The new test statistics converge in distribution to a unit normal under correct specification and grow to infinity faster than the parametric rate (n(-1/2)) under misspecification, while avoiding weighting, sample splitting, and non-nested testing procedures used elsewhere in the literature. Asymptotically, our tests can be viewed as a test of the joint hypothesis that the true parameters of a series regression model are zero, where the dependent variable is the residual from the parametric model, and the series terms are functions of the explanatory variables, chosen so as to support nonparametric estimation of a conditional expectation. We specifically consider Fourier series and regression splines, and present a Monte Carlo study of the finite sample performance of the new tests in comparison to consistent tests of Bierens (1990), Eubank and Spiegelman (1990), Jayasuriya (1990), Wooldridge (1992), and Yatchew (1992); the results show the new tests have good power, performing quite well in some situations. We suggest a joint Bonferroni procedure that combines a new test with those of Bierens and Wooldridge to capture the best features of the three approaches.

AB Sufficient conditions for Nash equilibrium in an n-person game are given in terms of what the players know and believe-about the game, and about each other's rationality, actions, knowledge, and beliefs. Mixed strategies are treated not as conscious randomizations, but as conjectures, on the part of other players, as to what a player will do. Common knowledge plays a smaller role in characterizing Nash equilibrium than had been supposed. When n = 2, mutual knowledge of the payoff functions, of rationality, and of the conjectures implies that the conjectures form a Nash equilibrium When n greater than or equal to 3 and there is a common prior, mutual knowledge of the payoff functions and of rationality, and common knowledge of the conjectures, imply that the conjectures form a Nash equilibrium. Examples show the results to be tight.

AB We add a round of pre-play communication to a finite two-player game played by a population of players. Pre-play communication is cheap talk in the sense that it does not directly enter the payoffs. The paper characterizes the set of strategies that are stable with respect to a stochastic dynamic adaptive process. Periodically players have an opportunity to change their strategy with a strategy that is more successful against the current population. Any strategy that weakly improves upon the current poorest performer in the population enters with positive probability. When there is no conflict of interest between the players, only the efficient outcome is stable with respect to these dynamics. For general games the set of stable payoffs is typically large. Every efficient payoff recurs infinitely often.

DE IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK; AGGREGATE RISK; DECISION THEORY; LARGE GAMES
ID EQUILIBRIUM; STRATEGIES; GAMES
AB The paper studies the representation and characterization of risks generated by a continuum of random variables. The Main Theorem is a characterization of a broad class of continuum processes in terms of the decomposition of risk into aggregate and idiosyncratic components, and in terms of the approximation of the continuum process by finite collections of random variables. This characterization is used to study decision making problems with anonymous and state-independent payoffs. An Extension Theorem shows that if such a payoff function is defined on simple processes, then it has a unique continuous extension to the class of processes characterized in this paper. This extension is formulated without reference to sample realizations and with minimal restrictions on the patterns of correlation between the random variables. As an application, the theory is used to develop a new model of large games which emphasizes the explicit description of the players' randomizations. This model is used to study the class of environments in which Schmeidler's (1973) representation of strategic uncertainty in large games is valid.

AB We investigate why 75% of United States households do not hold stocks despite the equity premium and predictions of expected-utility models. The question is relevant for privatisation, asset pricing, and tax progressivity issues. We show that risk aversion Pcr se, heterogeneity of beliefs, habit persistence, time non-separability, and quantity constraints on borrowing do not account for the phenomenon. A wedge between borrowing and lending rates, and minimum-investment requirements are plausible but empirically weak factors. More promising explanations are inertia and departures from expected-utility maximisation. There is also qualified support for nondiversifiable income risk as a contributing factor.

AB In this paper, we argue that measured (RPI) inflation is conceptually mismatched with core inflation: the difference is more than just 'measurement error'. We propose a technique for measuring core inflation, based on an explicit long-run economic hypothesis. Core inflation is defined as that component of measured inflation that has no (medium-to) long-run impact on real output - a notion that is consistent with the Vertical long-run Phillips curve interpretation of the comovements in inflation and output. We construct a measure of core inflation by placing dynamic restrictions on a Vector autoregression (VAR) system.

AB Inflation targeting is an important component of current UK economic policy and this paper examines the forecasting of inflation turning points using leading indicators. We identify nine complete inflation cycles between 1958 and 1993. Leading indicators are proposed, with composite shorter and longer leading indicators constructed on the basis of data to June 1992. Overall, the composite indicators give clear prior turning point information with relatively few 'false signals'. They exhibit leads at peaks which are generally longer than at troughs; correspondingly, we find that inflation troughs are generally more difficult to predict than peaks.

There are two categories of goods: the consumption levels in one group are committed to before the resolution of uncertainty and those of the other after. The paper proves that contrary to Atkinson and Stiglitz's (1976) result, differential commodity taxation remains a useful instrument of optimal tax policy even if preferences are separable between labour and produced goods.

AB Classical welfare economics demonstrates potential Pareto improvements from 'supply side' policy changes that increase the efficiency of aggregate production. Special cases reviewed here concern market integration through customs unions and the gains from international trade. These classical results require incentive incompatible lump-sum transfers. Generally, other policies must compensate deserving losers. Following Dixit and Norman, we consider a freeze of consumer post-tax prices, wages, and dividends, with tax rates and producer prices left to clear markets. Actual Pareto improvements are then generated by uniform poll subsidies. With appropriately distributed external tariff revenue, neither international transfers nor free disposal are required.

Here we introduce domestic politics into the analysis of international economic relations. We study the interactions between national leaders who are concerned with both providing a high standard of living to the general electorate and collecting campaign contributions from special-interest groups. Our analysis sheds light on the determinants of the structure of protection in noncooperative and cooperative policy equilibria.

AB Using an econometric model of charitable giving and a IO-year panel of tax return data, I find that previous studies have underestimated the effects of permanent income and overestimated the effects of permanent changes in tax prices. The significant statutory tax changes that occurred during the 1980s, especially in 1986, serve to identify the key model parameters. My results imply that people smooth their giving when transitory income changes but also time their giving to exploit transitory changes in tax prices. The results also raise questions about how effectively the tax incentives permanently influence the level, rather than just the timing, of charitable giving by individuals.

The theory is based on three fundamental postulates: that consumption of the addictive good is not equally harmful to all, that individuals possess subjective beliefs concerning this harm, and that beliefs are optimally updated with information gained through consumption. Although individual actions are optimal and dynamically consistent, addicts regret their past consumption decisions and regret their initial assessment of the potential harm of the good. Addict-prone individuals who belie iie ''it could not happen to them'' are most likely to be drawn into a harmful addiction.

A modified version of the Romer model that is consistent with this evidence is proposed, but the extended model alters a key implication usually found in endogenous growth theory. Although growth in the extended model is generated endogenously through R & D, the long-run growth rate depends only on parameters that are usually taken to be exogenous, including the rate of population growth.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
AB In standard durable-goods monopoly models, both the set of buyers and the set of prices are assumed to be continua. If the set of buyers is finite, the perfectly discriminating monopoly outcome is a unique subgame perfect equilibrium when the seller is sufficiently patient. Introducing instead a smallest unit of account yields the Coasian outcome as a generically unique subgame perfect equilibrium for patient enough buyers. A folk theorem is obtained if both sets are finite. These results reflect a strategic disadvantage of having to make moves with a large impact on other players' payoffs. The analysis is extended to durable-goods oligopoly.

TI BAIT AND SWITCH
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sellers sometimes practice a form of false advertising known as bait and switch. A low-priced good is advertised but replaced by a different good at the showroom. The practice is surprising since advertising the wrong good discourages the appropriate buyers from shopping, attracting customers who will be disappointed when they see the good. Firms bait and switch to draw a greater number of shoppers. The cost is that some who would have bought the good that is for sale may not bother to look. Under a variety of conditions, bait and switch is a profitable strategy resulting in a fully rational equilibrium with false advertising.

AB Most models of trade in speculative markets assume that agents interpret public information identically. We provide empirical evidence on the relation between the volume of trade and stock returns around public announcements, and we argue that the evidence is inconsistent with this assumption. We then develop a model of trade around public announcements that incorporates differential interpretations and is consistent with the observed volume-return relation. Then we test the standard model of belief revision underlying most models of trade using stock brokerage research analysts' earnings forecasts. The hypothesis of identical interpretations seems inconsistent with the forecast revisions in these data.

TI CHINA EVOLVING MANAGERIAL LABOR-MARKET
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

ID INDUSTRY; INFORMATION; EFFICIENCY; REFORM; STATE
AB Recent reforms of Chinese state-owned enterprises strengthened a nascent managerial labor market by incorporating incentives suggestive of competitive Western labor markets. Poorly performing firms were more likely to have a new manager selected by auction, to be required to post a higher security deposit, and to be subject to more frequent review of the manager's contract. Managers could be, and were, fired for poor performance. Managerial pay was linked to the firm's sales and profits, and reform strengthened the profit link and weakened the sales link. Thus the economic reforms helped develop an improved system of managerial resource allocation responsive to market forces.

AB Just like economists, voters have conflicting views about redistributive taxation because they estimate its incentive costs differently. We model rational agents as trying to learn from their dynastic income mobility experience the relative importance of effort and predetermined factors in the generation of income inequality and therefore the magnitude of these incentive costs. In the long run, ''left-wing dynasties'' believing less in individual effort and voting for more redistribution coexist with ''right-wing dynasties.'' This allows us to explain why individual mobility experience and not only current income matters for political attitudes and how persistent differences in perceptions about social mobility can generate persistent differences in redistribution across countries.

AB Decisions under uncertainty depend not only on the degree of uncertainty but also on its source, as illustrated by Ellsberg's observation of ambiguity aversion. In this article we propose the comparative ignorance hypothesis, according to which ambiguity aversion is produced by a comparison with less ambiguous events or with more knowledgeable individuals, This hypothesis is supported in a series of studies showing that ambiguity aversion, present in a comparative context in which a person evaluates both clear and vague prospects, seems to disappear in a noncomparative context in which a person evaluates only one of these prospects in isolation.

AB This paper suggests that decision-making under uncertainty is, at least partly, case-based. We propose a model in which cases are primitive, and provide a simple axiomatization of a decision role that chooses a ''best'' ad based on its past performance in similar cases. Each act is evaluated by the sum of the utility levels that resulted from using this act in past cases, each weighted by the similarity of that past case to the problem at hand. The formal model of case-based decision theory naturally gives rise to the notions of satisficing decisions and aspiration levels.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB This paper documents the fundamental role played by factor accumulation in explaining the extraordinary postwar growth of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Participation rates, educational levels, and (excepting I-long Kong) investment rates have risen rapidly in all four economies. In addition, in most cases there has been a large intersectoral transfer of labor into manufacturing, which has helped fuel growth in that sector. Once one accounts for the dramatic rise in factor inputs, one arrives at estimated total factor productivity growth rates that are closely approximated by the historical performance of many of the OECD and Latin American economies. While the growth of output and manufacturing exports in the newly industrializing countries of East Asia is virtually unprecedented, the growth of total factor productivity in these economies is not.

AB Market responses to legislative reforms often mitigate the expected gains that reformers promise in legislation. Contemporaries hailed workers' compensation as a boon to workers because it raised the amount of postaccident compensation paid to injured workers. Despite the large gains to workers, employers often supported the legislation. Analysis of several wage samples from the early 1900s shows that employers were able to pass a significant part of the added costs of higher postaccident compensation on to some workers in the form of reductions in wages. The size of the wage offsets, however, was smaller for union workers.

The environment considered is an extension of the standard symmetric-information risk-sharing model that allows for the possibility of enforcement problems on the part of both the employer and the employee. We show that this class of risk-sharing model unambiguously predicts hours to be influenced by wages only through an income effect. Using data from the PSID, we find evidence in favor of this extended version of the risk-sharing model.

We argue that differences in the behavior of governors who face a binding term limit and those who are able to run again provides a source of variation in discount rates that can be used to test a political agency model. We find evidence that taxes, spending, and other policy instruments respond to a binding term limit if a Democrat is in office. The result is a fiscal cycle in term-limit states, which lowers state income when the term limit binds.

We investigate whether the volume of trade between OECD countries is consistent with the predictions of a model in which all trade is intraindustry trade in differentiated products. We then repeat the test with non-OECD countries. We also investigate whether the share of intraindustry trade is consistent with a more general theoretical model in which some, but not all, trade is intraindustry trade. Our results lead us to question the apparent empirical success of these models.

AB Individual income is much more variable than aggregate per capita income.  I argue that aggregate information is therefore not very important for individual consumption decisions and study models of life-cycle consumption in which individuals react optimally to their own income process but have incomplete or no information on economy-wide variables.  Since individual income is less persistent than aggregate income consumers will react too little to aggregate income variation.  Aggregate consumption will be excessively smooth.  Since aggregate information is slowly incorporated into consumption, aggregate consumption will be autocorrelated and correlated with lagged income.  On the other hand, the model has the same prediction for micro data as the standard permanent income model.  The second part of the paper provides empirical evidence on individual and aggregate income processes.  Different models for individual income are fit to quarterly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation making various adjustments for measurement error.  Calibrating the consumption model using the estimated parameters for the income process yields predictions which qualitatively correspond to the empirical findings for aggregate consumption but do not match them well in magnitude.

AB This paper develops techniques for empirically analyzing demand and supply in differentiated products markets and then applies these techniques to analyze equilibrium in the U.S. automobile industry.  Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry.  When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.

AB This paper develops and estimates a model of the U.S. Automobile Industry.  On the demand side, a discrete choice model is adopted, that is estimated using micro data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.  The estimation results are used in conjunction with population weights to derive aggregate demand.  On the supply side, the automobile industry is modelled as an oligopoly with product differentiation.  Equilibrium is characterized by the first order conditions of the profit maximizing firms.  The estimation results are used in counterfactual simulations to investigate two trade policy issues:  the effects of the VER, and exchange rate pass-through.

ID MODELS; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION; INFERENCE; MOMENTS; MARKET; PRICE
AB In this paper we propose an estimation method for the empirical study of theoretical acuction models.  We focus on first-price sealed bid and descending auctions and we adopt the private value paradigm, where each bidder is assumed to have a different private value, only known to him, for the object that is auctioned.
   Following McFadden (1989) and Pakes and Pollard (1989), our proposed method is based on simulations.  Specifically, the method relies on a simulated nonlinear least squares objective function appropriately adjusted so as to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest.
   We illustrate the proposed method by studying a market of agricultural products, where descending auctions are used.  Our analysis takes into account heterogeneity of the auctioned objects and the fact that only the winning bid is observed.  We estimate the parameters that characterize the distribution of the unobserved private values for each auctioned object.

For this purpose, we use a two-sector model with Leontief production functions and construct a condition under which the optimal transition function is unimodal and expansive.  We demonstrate that the set of parameter values satisfying that condition is nonempty no matter how weakly the future utilities are discounted.

ID INEQUALITY
AB In Soviet-type economies, commodity prices were distorted as part of the redistributive system of the state, but with the transition, prices have been liberalised and taxes made more uniform. Has this change adversely affected the distribution of purchasing power? The paper develops a new method of measuring the distributional impact of price changes by computing the distributional characteristics of commodities from household budget survey data, and applies it to Hungary and the United Kingdom, finding that the distributional impacts over the past decade were negligible and not significantly different from zero in both cases.

Since there is clear evidence of nonlinearity, we follow other researchers in this field by applying the same tests to the residuals from a GARCH process fitted to the data, in order to find out whether or not the nonlinearity can be explained by this type of model. In the event, our results suggest that GARCH can explain some but not all of the observed nonlinear dependence.

AB This paper attempts to formalise herd behaviour or mutual mimetic contagion in speculative markets. The emergence of bubbles is explained as a self-organising process of infection among traders leading to equilibrium prices which deviate from fundamental values. It is postulated furthermore that the speculators' readiness to follow the crowd depends on one basic economic variable, namely actual returns. Above average returns are reflected in a generally more optimistic attitude that fosters the disposition to overtake others' bullish beliefs and vice versa. This economic influence makes bubbles transient phenomena and leads to repeated fluctuations around fundamental values.

AB This paper develops a search-theoretic approach to optimal growth where agents anticipate continuing technology advance. When agents require an adaptive search investment to 'match with' any new technology, but when this learning is depreciated at the inception of the next, we show that an economy will sustain either an equilibrium with frequent advances, coupled with inefficient matching, or one with exactly the opposite characteristics. The cyclical implication is chat the immediate effect of technology adoption is a downturn, not a boom. The model offers a broader representation of Schumpeterian creative destruction, while augmenting the human capital foundations of endogenous growth theory.

There is clear evidence of a long-term secular relation between the level of innovative activity and the level of economic activity, although this may have changed in the I980s. Finally, the data provide no reason for thinking that these clusters of innovation cause cyclic variations in economic activity, but variations in economic activity do Granger cause changes in innovative activity.

AB Questionnaire studies suggest that perceptions of fairness cause people to resist price increases following abrupt changes in conditions with no cost justification. This hypothesis is examined in posted-offer markets extending previous work. Consistent with the hypothesis, in the profit disclosure (fairness) treatment prices are initially below those in the cost and the no disclosure treatments. Put over time prices in all treatments converge to the competitive surplus maximising equilibrium. Thus 'fairness' is interpreted as being the result of expectations that are not sustainable. Expectations adapt as the market converges to the standard competitive equilibrium prediction.

AB In a contest, participants spend money or effort to increase their chances of winning a prize. We examine primarily the following question: Could the timid (the more risk averse) have a better chance of winning in contests ? Under limited liability the answer is always positive. In the absence of limited liability there is no single answer, whereas when the prize is shared as a function of effort the outcome is independent of the contestants' risk aversion. We also relate our results to self-protection and examine some other implications of risk aversion.

Measurement of the impact and benefit of inside information is difficult because its use for financial gain is often illegal, Ideally one would like to investigate and compare two mutually isolated groups, one with and the other without access to inside information. The Australian horse betting market offers such an opportunity. It is found that even exposure to 'second hand' inside information effects a change in behaviour, a rise in payoffs and adds power and significance to the prediction of race results.

The asymptotic distributions of generalized method of moments estimators and corresponding test statistics are derived using this framework. The asymptotic distributions are shown to be the same with deterministically trending variables as with non-trending variables. That is, the distributions are normal and chi-squared respectively. The asymptotic covariance matrices of the estimators, however, are found to depend on the form of the trends. These findings provide a justification for the use of standard asymptotic approximations in nonlinear models even when the variables have deterministic trends.

AB One of the important determinants of fertility is the value of children as perceived by parents. This paper estimates gender- and age-specific values of children using a dynamic programming model. The underlying hypothesis is that observed fertility outcome for any couple is the solution to their life-cycle optimization problem. Findings from the Korean data indicate that children impose net costs when young and net benefits when old. Both the early costs and the later benefits are larger for male children than female children, and for better-educated women than lower-educated women. Simulation studies which use estimated values of children suggest that a decrease in the costs of abortion and pre-natal gender-screening tests may raise the male-birth ratio through gender-selective abortions.

ID EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; AGRICULTURE; TENANCY
AB This paper develops a theory of sharecropping which emphasizes the dual role of moral hazard in the provision of effort and financial constraints. The model is compatible with a large variety of contracts as observed in the region of El Oulja in Tunisia. Using an original data set including financial data, various tests of the theory are undertaken. Production functions stressing the role of effort are estimated. The data support the theory which predicts lower efficiency when the tenant's share of output is lower. The role of financial constraints in explaining which type of contract is selected (as well as the implications that financial constraints have upon effort and therefore output) are supported by the data.

ID CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION; IMPERFECT INFORMATION; INSURANCE MARKETS; AGENCY
   COSTS; EQUILIBRIUM; SELECTION; CREDIT
AB This paper examines how the possibility of recontracting affects the financing of projects when an entrepreneur is privately informed about the distribution of returns. We consider a game where an entrepreneur solicits initial financing for a project from competing uninformed financiers. Once the project is undertaken, but before its returns are realized, the entrepreneur can solicit additional financial contracts from competing financiers. It is assumed that these financiers can observe all previously signed contracts and that the seniority of claims is respected in the case of bankruptcy; however, the entrepreneur is never committed not to sell junior claims to competing financiers. The main results of the paper are that (1) the equilibrium is characterized by separation but nevertheless the modalities of financing depend critically on the market's priors about the project's riskiness, in particular, the amount of collateral posted by the entrepreneur varies with the market's prior perceptions about the project, (2) when the market is optimistic about the project, there exists a unique equilibrium outcome, it is separating, but the standard incentive-compatibility constraints are not binding, (3) even if the market is very pessimistic about a project's chances of success, there always exists an equilibrium in which a good project receives sufficient financing, that is, the market does not collapse due to a Lemons effect, (4) the entrepreneur's inability to commit not to recontract may be considered Pareto improving in certain situations. We discuss how the results of the paper may help explain observed financial flows.

ID CORPORATE-CONTROL; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; VOTING-RIGHTS; ONE VOTE; MARKET;
   SHARE; COSTS; DEBT
AB This paper focuses on the role of an initial public offering (IPO) in maximizing the proceeds an initial owner obtains in selling his company. In deciding whether to undertake an IPO, and what fraction of ownership to retain, the initial owner must balance two factors. By selling to dispersed shareholders, he maximizes his proceeds from the sale of cash flow rights. However, by directly bargaining with a potential buyer, he maximizes his proceeds from the sale of control rights. Whether a company should be private or public, as well as the insider's ownership in public companies, depends on the particular combination of majority control and dispersed ownership which maximizes the incumbent's wealth. The model provides implications on the strategy to be followed in selling a company as well as on the timing of IPOs and going-private transactions.

The optimal rate of RandD is shown to be the same for all preferences in a broad family, while the competitive rate is sensitive to the form of substitutability among products and so can vary dramatically within a family. The second-best level of RandD is shown to be also common within a family and equal to the optimal rate. Numerical examples suggest that diminishing returns in the innovation technology is the most important potential source for excessive RandD in a competitive economy.

AB We investigate the structure of competitive equilibria in an exchange economy parametrized by (i) endowments and (ii) restrictions on market participation. For arbitrary regular endowments, if few consumers are restricted, there are no sunspot equilibria. If endowments are allowed to vary, while restrictions on market participation are fixed, there is a generic set of preferences such that sunspot equilibria exist for a non-empty subset of endowments. Our analysis extends to the general case of an arbitrary number of restricted consumers the results of Cass and Shell for the polar cases in which either (i) no consumers are restricted or (ii) all consumers are restricted.

The increases examined in Kentucky and Michigan raised the benefit amount for high-earnings individuals by approximately 50 percent, while low-earnings individuals, who were unaffected by the benefit maximum, did nor experience a change in their incentives. Time out of work increased for those eligible for the higher benefits and remained unchanged for those whose benefits were constant. The estimated duration elasticities are clustered around 0.3-0.4.

This paper investigates the link between the ethnic externality and ethnic neighborhoods. The evidence indicates that residential segregation and the external effect of ethnicity are linked, partly because ethnic capital summarizes the socioeconomic background of the neighborhood where the children were raised. Ethnicity has an external effect, even among persons who grow up in the same neighborhood, when children are exposed frequently to persons who share the same ethnic background.

We find that the introduction of an ESOP will lead to a 4-5-percent increase in productivity; this productivity payoff takes 3-4 years. There is a modest productivity gain from the bonus system. We also find evidence that the productivity effect of bonuses is enhanced by the existence of ESOP's, suggesting that ESOP's may create a climate conducive to profit-sharing by enhancing long-term commitment and peer monitoring.

Second, I show that supermarket chains were more likely to enter and expand in a local market if a large share of the incumbent firms in the local market undertook LBO's. The study suggests that leverage increases in the late 1980's led to softer product-market competition in this industry.

AB The time-series literature reports two stylized facts about output dynamics in the United States: GNP growth is positively autocorrelated, and GNP appears to have an important trend-reverting component. This paper investigates whether current real-business-cycle (RBC) models are consistent with these stylized facts. Many RBC models have weak internal propagation mechanisms and must rely on external sources of dynamics to replicate both facts. Models that incorporate labor adjustment costs are partially successful. They endogenously generate positive autocorrelation in output growth, but they need implausibly large transitory shocks to match the trend-reverting component in output.

AB This paper presents an aggregate demand-driven model of business cycles that provides a new explanation for the procyclicality of productivity and simultaneously predicts large welfare losses from monetary nonneutrality. The key features of the model are an input-output production structure, imperfect competition, countercyclical markups, and for some results, state-dependent price rigidity. True technical efficiency is procyclical even though production takes place with constant returns, without technology shocks or technological externalities. The paper has observable implications that distinguish it empirically from related work. These implications are generally supported by data from U.S. manufacturing industries.

AB We propose and implement a new test of the dividend signaling hypothesis. Dividend signaling models generally imply that an increase in dividend taxation should increase the share price response per dollar of dividends (or ''bang-for-the-buck''). Many other dividend-preference theories have the opposite implication. An analysis of recent variations in tax policy reveals a strong positive relation between dividend tax rates and the bang-for-the-buck. Additional evidence on the relation between the bang-for-the-buck and other variables that are related to the marginal cost of paying dividend's provides further support for dividend signaling.

TI COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP RULES AND PRIVATE SAVING
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

DT Article
AB This paper examines the effect of existing college scholarship rules on the incentive to save. The analysis shows that families that are eligible for college scholarships face ''education tax rates'' on capital income of between 22 percent and 47 percent in addition to regular federal and state income taxes. The empirical analysis developed here, based on the 1986 Survey of Consumer Finances, implies that these high lax rates have a powerful adverse effect on the accumulation of financial assets.

AB We argue that long-term debt has a role in controlling management's ability to finance future investments. Companies with high (widely held) debt will find it hard to mise capital, since new security-holders will have low priority relative to existing creditors; conversely for companies with low debt. We show that there is an optimal debt - equity ratio and mix of senior and junior debt if management undertakes unprofitable as well as profitable investments. We derive conditions under which equity and a single class of senior long-term debt work as well as more complex contracts for controlling investment behavior.

AB Currently available health insurance contracts often fail to insure long-term illnesses:  sick people can suffer large increases in premiums or denial of coverage.  I describe insurance contracts that solve this problem.  Their key feature is a severance payment.  A person who is diagnosed with a long-term illness and whose premiums are increased receives a lump sum equal to the increased present value of premiums.  This lump sum allows him or her to pay the higher premiums required by any insurer.  People are not tied to a particular insurer or a group, and the improvement is free:  insurance companies can operate at zero economic profits, and consumers can pay exactly the same premium they do with standard contracts.

ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; POLICY; MODEL
AB Recent estimates of the potential growth effects of tax reform vary wildly, ranging from zero to eight percentage points.  Using an endogenous growth model, we assess which model features and parameter values are important for determining the quantitative impact of tax reform.  We find that the critical parameters are factor shares, depreciation rates, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and the elasticity of labor supply.  The elasticities of substitution in production, on the other hand, are relatively unimportant.  The quantitative estimates in several recent papers are compared with each other and with some of the evidence from U.S. experience.  We find that Robert Lucas's conclusion, that tax reform would have little or no effect on the U.S. growth rate, is theoretically robust and consistent with the evidence.

AB This paper uses a Treasury Department panel of more than 4,000 taxpayers to estimate the sensitivity of taxable income to changes in tax rates on the basis of a comparison of the tax returns of the same individual taxpayers before and after the 1986 tax reform.  The analysis emphasizes that the response of taxable income involves much more than a change in the traditional measures of labor supply.  The evidence shows an elasticity of taxable income with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate that is at least one and could be substantially higher.  The implications for recent tax rate changes are discussed.

AB Many services provide outputs that depend partially on the customers as inputs; the presence of other customers often contributes to the output experienced by each purchaser.  Higher education is the premier example; others are legion.  We provide a simple model that addresses the questions of competitive pricing and allocative efficiency for these types of services.  Prices that charge customers for what they get on net (output minus input) from the firm both are competitive and support efficient allocations; these prices internalize the apparent external effects of customers on each other.  Few examples of such prices exist in the real world.

TI FISCAL EFFECTS OF THE VOTER INITIATIVE - EVIDENCE FROM THE LAST 30 YEARS
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB In 23 American states, citizens can initiate and approve laws by popular vote; in the other 27 states, laws can be proposed only by elected representatives.  This paper compares the fiscal behavior of state and local governments over the last 30 years under these two institutional arrangements.  The main finding is that spending is significantly lower, on the order of 4 percent, in states with voter initiatives than in pure representative states.  It is also found that local spending is higher and state spending is lower in initiative states.  On the revenue side, initiative states rely less on broad-based taxes and more on charges tied to services.  Taken together, the evidence indicates that the initiative leads to a reduction in the over-all size of the government sector and suggests that it causes a decline in the level of redistributional activity.

The model offers simple and intuitive predictions about exchange rates and current accounts that sometimes differ sharply from those of either modern flexible-price intertemporal models or traditional sticky-price Keynesian models.  Our analysis leads to a novel perspective on the international welfare spillovers due to monetary and fiscal policies.

I test this by estimating Engel curves on a cross section of Japanese extended families forming two-generation households.  I find that the pattern of food expenditure is significantly affected by the division of resources.  The food components whose budget share increases with the older generation's share of household income are precisely those favored by the old such as cereal, seafood, and vegetables.

AB The starting point of this paper is a simple, regular dynamic game in which subgame-perfect equilibrium fails to exist. Examination of this example shows that existence would be restored if players were allowed to observe the output of a public-randomization device. The main result of the paper shows that the introduction of public randomization yields existence not only in the example, but also in a large class of dynamic games. It is also argued that the introduction of public randomization is the minimal robust extension of subgame-perfect equilibrium in this class of games.

ID REPEATED GAMES; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; BARGAINING MODEL; DELAY
AB Rubinstein's alternating-offers bargaining model is enriched by assuming that players' payoffs in disagreement periods are determined by a normal form game. It is shown that such a model can have multiple perfect equilibria, including inefficient ones, provided that players are sufficiently patient. Delay is possible even though there is perfect information and the players are fully rational. The length of delay depends only on the payoff structure of the disagreement game and not on the discount factor. Not ail feasible and individually rational payoffs of the disagreement game can be supported as average disagreement payoffs. Indeed, some negotiation games have a unique perfect equilibrium with immediate agreement.

ID MORAL HAZARD; INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; PRINCIPAL; EQUILIBRIA; AGENCY; GAMES
AB This paper studies moral hazard contracts that may be renegotiated after an agent chooses an unobservable effort. Unlike in previous models, a contract here contains only one compensation scheme, and the agent has all the bargaining power in the renegotiation stage. Using a relatively weak forward-induction refinement, all equilibria are shown fo be (second-best) efficient. Renegotiation occurs in every equilibrium. If the effort set is rich, the only equilibrium initial contract is a sales contract, i.e., a scheme which ''sells the project'' to the agent. This captures the idea that a party (the principal) who has an inherently weak renegotiation position will sometimes insist on a simple initial contract.

AB We analyze optimal mechanisms in environments where sellers are privately informed about quality. A methodology is provided for deriving conditions that are necessary and sufficient to determine when two simple trading environments maximize either social or private surplus. The commonly used auction mechanism is frequently inefficient in procurement environments. Often, the optimal mechanism is simply to order potential suppliers and to tender take-it-or-leave-it offers to each sequentially. We completely characterize the environments in which either mechanism is optimal. In doing so, we develop a general methodology that determines when and if a given trading institution is optimal.

AB We consider a model where two agents, privately informed about their own characteristics, play a (normal form) game on behalf of two uninformed principals. We analyze the existence of precommitment effects through public announcements of contracts, in a model where agency contracts, designed ex-ante, can always be secretly renegotiated, at the ex-ante and interim stages. We show that the existence of precommitment effects depends both on the strategic complementarity of the agents' actions and on the direct effect of the opponents' actions on each principal's welfare. In our model, the possibility of renegotiation is crucial for the existence of precommitment effects. The results are introduced through an example of Cournot and Bertrand competition between firms, viewed as vertical structures.

AB We show that, under certain regularity conditions, if the distribution of income is price independent and satisfies a condition on the shape of its graph, then total market demand, F(p), is monotone; i.e., given two positive prices, p and q, one has (p - q) (F(p)- F(q)) < 0. These results allow for density functions increasing on some intervals, like unimodal distributions or even densities with more than one peak.
   Similar assumptions on the distribution of endowments, yield a restricted monotonicity property on aggregate excess demand, where, now, wealth is determined by market prices. This property guarantees uniqueness and stability of equilibrium of the Walrasian pure exchange economy.

AB With the same normalization as that for standard parametric statistics, and centered at a parameter of interest, many semiparametric estimates based on n observations have been shown to be root-n-consistent and asymptotically normal. In the context of semiparametric averaged derivative estimates, we go further by showing that the rate of convergence of the finite-sample distribution to the normal limit distribution can equal that of standard parametric statistics.

AB Using a Simulated Method of Moments approach, I evaluate a representative consumer asset pricing model in which the consumer is assumed to have time nonseparable preferences of several forms. Examining the model's implications for several moments of asset returns, I find evidence for the local substitution of consumption with habit formation occurring over longer periods of time. The interaction between these two effects is important. I also show that, when accounting for sampling error, a model with local substitution and long-run habit persistence is consistent with the Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds.

ID COORDINATION GAMES; EQUILIBRIA; BEHAVIOR
AB The paper presents a theoretical framework which distinguishes between the strategic structure of a game (the 'existential game') and the way the players describe the game to themselves.  Each player works with a private description of the game, in which strategies are identified by labels; labels are generated by a stochastic labelling procedure.  Each player chooses a decision rule which, for each possible private description, picks one of the available strategy labels.  A criterion of collective rationality is applied to choices among decision rules.  The implications of collective rationality are explored for a range of games with different labelling procedures.

TI PRICES, CREDIT MARKETS AND CHILD GROWTH IN LOW-INCOME RURAL-AREAS
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PERMANENT INCOME; CONSUMPTION; INDIA
AB In this paper it is argued that fluctuations in child growth in rural areas of Bangladesh during and after severe floods in 1988 can provide insight into the structure of credit markets.  A model of intertemporal resource allocation is developed and Euler equations relating growth patterns of children to the cost of borrowing by household are then derived from the model.  The evidence indicates that although some of the variation in growth patterns over the relevant period may be attributed to variation in illness and the price of rice, growth patterns for children in landless households were influenced by credit market imperfections.

AB The model of this paper highlights two aspects of credibility:  signalling the type of government, which is assumed not to be known; and, for any type, the likelihood that if circumstances are sufficiently unfavourable a devaluation will be impossible to avoid, since not to do so would go against the government's interests.  These two factors have opposite implications for the link between unemployment and interest differentials:  high unemployment signals a tough government, but also makes it less likely that even a tough government will maintain an existing parity.

ID RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; DYNAMICS
AB A model is developed in which a continuum of agents makes interdependent output decisions in a stochastic environment characterised by strategic complementarity.  Two groups are distinguished:  naive agents follow a costless adaptive expectations rule, while sophisticated agents incur an optimisation cost to achieve self-fulfilling expectations.  The paper studies the dynamics generated as the population composition evolves under pressure of differential payoffs.  Sophisticated agents are favoured if optimisation is cheap or the stochastic environment highly variable, but naive agents generally persist.  A higher long-run share of sophisticated agents is associated with greater output variability and low output persistence.

TI MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ACTIVE LABOR-MARKET PROGRAMS IN A UNION
   WAGE-SETTING MODEL
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent Western European policy debate on unemployment has emphasised the benefits of active labour market programmes.  We analyse the effects on wage pressure and equilibrium employment in a union wage-setting framework.  Programmes are wage-reducing to the extent that they help maintain effective labour-force participation.  But they may also weaken insider incentives for wage restraint as the disutility of lay-offs becomes smaller.  Targeting the long-term unemployed is crucial for the success of active labour market policy, since the welfare effects on the laid-off then are more heavily discounted and employment opportunities are redistributed from insiders to outsiders.

TI LABOR DEMAND AND THE SOURCE OF ADJUSTMENT COSTS

AB To examine the importance of the two sources of costs of adjusting labour demand, net costs (of adjusting employment) and gross costs (of hiring and firing), I collect new sets of short monthly time series, from a medium-size hospital and three manufacturing plants.  Models with quadratic costs and with lumpy costs are developed and yield lower bounds on the fraction of adjustment costs that are gross.  The estimates demonstrate that both types of costs affect dynamic labour demand, but that gross adjustment costs especially, and the turnover that generates them, deserve much more attention.

ID INDEXATION
AB Many rational wage setting schemes, such as the trade unions paradigm, are usually thought to lead to pure real rigidities.  In this article we construct a model where a rational trade union without any kind of money illusion sets wage schedules in an economy subject to real and monetary shocks.  We make the realistic assumption that wages can be conditioned on prices.  It is found that, although the trade union has the option of fully insulating workers from nominal disturbances, it will rationally choose not to do so, and therefore nominal rigidities will be present in the economy.

AB The British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS) is a UK-wide survey that provides a rich source of information on individuals attitudes to a variety of topics including locally provided service.  In this paper we seek to model answers to questions on attitudes to local authority spending which invite the expression of a private demand for local public spending.  A convincing picture has emerged of locally provided public goods as imperfectly congested public goods, with a price elastic and probably income inelastic demand.  The view that central government grants may induce voter confusion over tax prices of public services also finds support.
