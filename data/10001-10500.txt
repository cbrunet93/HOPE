SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

ID ART
AB The anomaly is concerned with the observation that in multiple-item auctions of identical objects, prices tend to decline over time. I show that in the case of wine auctions, which have been analyzed frequently, the anomaly is likely to be caused by the fast that most bids are entered by absentees, who use nonoptimal bidding strategies. Therefore, wine auctions can hardly be used to illustrate the standard multiple-object auction model.

ID DECISIONS; DEMAND; MODEL
AB The neoclassical theory of demand applies to individuals, yet in empirical work it is usually taken as valid for households with many members. This paper explores what the theory of individuals implies for households that have more than one member. We make minimal assumptions about how the individual members of the household resolve conflicts. All we assume is that however decisions are made, outcomes are efficient. We refer to this as the collective setting. We show that in the collective setting household demands must satisfy a symmetry and rank condition on the Slutsky matrix. We also present some further results on the effects on demands of variables that do not modify preferences but that do affect how decisions are made.
   We apply our theory to a series of surveys of household expenditures from Canada. The tests of the usual symmetry conditions are rejected for two-person households but not for one-person households. We also show that income pooling is rejected for two-person households. We then test for out collective setting conditions on the couples data. None of the collective setting restrictions are rejected. We conclude that the collective setting is a plausible and tractable next step to take in the analysis of household behavior.

AB This paper is about the economic theory of biodiversity presentation. A cost-effectiveness methodology is constructed, which results in a particular formula that can be used as a criterion to rank projects. The ranking criterion is sufficiently operational to be useful in suggesting what to look at when determining actual conservation priorities among endangered species. At the same time, the formula is firmly rooted in a mathematically rigorous optimization framework, so that its theoretical underpinnings are clear. The underlying model, called the "Noah's Ark Problem," is intended to be a kind of canonical form that hones down to its analytical essence the problem of best preserving diversity under a limited budget constraint.

AB Some new tools for analyzing spurious regressions are presented. The theory utilizes the general representation of a stochastic process in terms of an orthonormal system and provides an extension of the Weierstrass theorem to include the approximation of continuous functions and stochastic processes by Wiener processes. The theory is applied to two classic examples of spurious regressions: regression of stochastic trends on time polynomials, and regressions among independent random walks. It is shown that such regressions reproduce in part and in whole the underlying orthonormal representations.

ID SAMPLE QUANTILE; ESTIMATORS
AB The least-absolute-deviations (LAD) estimator for a median-regression model does not satisfy the standard conditions for obtaining asymptotic refinements through use of the bootstrap because the LAD objective function is not smooth. This paper overcomes this problem by smoothing the objective function. The smoothed estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the standard LAD estimator. With bootstrap critical values, the rejection probabilities of symmetrical t and chi(2) tests based on the smoothed estimator are correct through O(n(-gamma)) under the null hypothesis, where gamma < 1 but can be arbitrarily close to I. In contrast, first-order asymptotic approximations make errors of size O(n(-gamma)). These results also hold for symmetrical t and chi(2) tests for censored median regression models.

AB We examine a simple bargaining setting, where heterogeneous buyers and sellers are repeatedly matched with each other. We begin by characterizing efficiency in such a dynamic setting, and discuss how it differs from efficiency in a centralized static setting. We then study the allocations which can result in equilibrium when the matched buyers and sellers bargain through some extensive game form. We take an implementation approach? characterizing the possible allocation rules which result as the extensive game form is varied. We are particularly concerned with the impact of making trade voluntary: imposing individual rationality on and off the equilibrium path. No buyer or seller consumates an agreement which leaves them worse off than the discounted expected value of their future rematching in the market. Finally, we compare and contrast the Efficient allocations with those that could ever arise as the equilibria of some voluntary negotiation procedure.

AB We consider the problem of making asymptotically valid inference on structural parameters in instrumental variables regression with weak instruments. Using the local-to-zero asymptotics of Staiger and Stock (1997), we derive the asymptotic distributions of LR and LM type statistics for testing simple hypotheses on structural parameters based on maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimation methods. In contrast to the nonstandard limiting behavior of Wald statistics, the limiting distributions of certain LM and LR statistics are bounded by a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom given by the number of instruments. Further, we show how to construct asymptotically valid confidence sets for structural parameters by inverting these statistics.

In this article I relax this assumption, which is both unnecessarily strict and unrealistic. The contribution is twofold. First, I show that when control is delegated during flotation, financial innovation is a trade off between agency costs (arising from principal agent relationships) and targeting Costs (arising from the inability to split the cash flow). Second, I show that unlevered equity or the use of debt which can be issued without defaulting in equilibrium, are optimal means of financing.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

ID CENTRAL-BANK INDEPENDENCE
AB This paper considers the likely operating characteristics of the new UK monetary arrangements introduced in May 1997. The paper first argues that the time inconsistency of policy is not an issue provided the Bank of England is properly independent. However, the current inflation remit from the Chancellor to the Bank specifies a numerical target for the inflation rate, but does not specify how quickly deviations from the target are to be corrected. It is thus an incomplete contract, and there is a danger that the Bank may choose to stabilise inflation at the cost of excessively volatile movements in output, or vice versa. We estimate the optimal policy frontier for the UK economy and show that in practice it is close to rectangular. Consequently all the Bank needs to assume is that the government's preferences are 'reasonable' in order to know approximately where to locate on this frontier; the incompleteness of the remit therefore need not be a cause for concern.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

ID MONETARY
AB Establishment of the European Central Bank presents a rare opportunity to define the operations of a central bank without a prior track record. This paper asks what might Ire learnt from the recent experience of inflation targeting at the Bank of England before the ECB specifies an, as yet undefined, operational target. We consider whether there should be single or multiple targets and which inflation measure should be used, if at all. If inflation is targeted then a forecast of its value becomes the intermediate variable. This raises an issue of transparency and the compensating supply of information necessary to fill the gap, but too much 'openness' can also be problematic. The ECB must be accountable and the contracting approach may be useful although being seen to 'say' and 'do' the same thing is ultimately most important.

AB We address long-standing problems in measuring medical inflation by estimating two types of price indices. The first, a Service Price Index, prices specific medical services, as does the current CPI. The second, a Cost of Living Index, measures a quality-adjusted cost of treating a health problem. We apply these indices to heart attack treatment between 1983 and 1994. More frequent reweighting and accounting for price discounts lowers the measured price change for heart attacks by three percentage points annually. Accounting for quality change lowers it further; we estimate that the real Cost of Living Index fell about 1 percent annually.

AB We model growth and technology transfer in a world where technologies are specific to particular combinations of inputs. Unlike the usual specification, our model does not imply that an improvement in one technique for producing a given good improves all other techniques for producing that good. Technology improvements diffuse slowly across countries, although knowledge spreads instantaneously and there are no technology adoption costs. However, even with "Ak" production, our model implies conditional convergence. This model, with appropriate technology and technology diffusion, has more realistic predictions for convergence and growth than either the standard neoclassical model or simple endogenous-growth models.

ID GROWTH; DEMAND; LABOR
AB A high proportion of skilled workers in the labor force implies a large market size for skill-complementary technologies, and encourages faster upgrading of the productivity of skilled workers. As a result, an increase in the supply of skills reduces the skill premium in the short run, but then it induces skill-biased technical change and increases the skill premium, possibly even above its initial value. This theory suggests that the rapid increase in the proportion of college graduates in the United States labor force in the 1970s may have been a causal factor in both the decline in the college premium during the 1970s and the large increase in inequality during the 1980s.

The first is that such technological innovations are not everywhere adopted, but only in countries with high productivity. The second result is that technology adoption significantly amplifies differences in productivity between countries. This paper can, therefore, add to our understanding of large and persistent international differences in output per capita. The model also helps to explain other growth phenomena, like divergence or periods of rapid growth.

AB Is there too much or too little research and development (R&D)? In this paper we bridge the gap between the recent growth literature and the empirical productivity literature. We derive in a growth model the relationship between the social rate of return to R&D and the coefficient estimates of the empirical literature and show that these estimates represent a lower bound. Furthermore, our analytic framework provides a direct mapping from the rate of return to the degree of underinvestment in research. Conservative estimates suggest that optimal R&D investment is at least two to four times actual investment.

AB In 1839 the French government purchased the Daguerreotype patent and placed it in the public domain. Such patent buyouts could potentially eliminate the monopoly price distortions and incentives for rent-stealing duplicative research created by patents, while increasing incentives for original research. Governments could offer to purchase patents at their estimated private value, as determined in an auction, times a markup equal to the typical ratio of inventions' social and private value. Most patents purchased would be placed in the public domain, but to induce bidders to reveal their valuations, a few would be sold to the highest bidder.

An analysis of aggregate changes in the relative supplies and wages of workers by education from 1940 to 1996 indicates strong and persistent growth in relative demand favoring college graduates. Rapid skill upgrading within detailed industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, particularly since 1970. Analyses of four data sets indicate that the rate of skill upgrading has been greater in more computer-intensive industries.

We investigate whether a directly observed measure of technical change (R&D intensity) is closely linked to the growth in the importance of more highly skilled workers which has occurred in all countries. Evidence of a significant association between skill upgrading and R&D intensity is uncovered in all seven countries. These results provide evidence that skill-biased technical change is an international phenomenon that has had a clear effect of increasing the relative demand for skilled workers.

ID WAGE INEQUALITY; DEMAND
AB Demand for less-skilled workers plummeted in developed countries in the 1980s. In open economies, pervasive skill-biased technological change (SBTC) can explain this decline. SBTC tends to increase the domestic supply of unskill-intensive goods by releasing less-skilled labor. The more countries experiencing a SBTC, the greater its potential to decrease the relative wages of less-skilled labor by increasing the world supply of unskill-intensive goods. We find strong evidence for pervasive SBTC in developed countries. Most industries increased the proportion of skilled workers despite generally rising or stable relative wages. Moreover, the same manufacturing industries simultaneously increased demand for skills in different countries. Many developing countries also show increased skill premiums, a pattern consistent with SBTC.

AB How do movements in the distribution of income and wealth affect the macroeconomy? We analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. Our main finding is that, in the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative-agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross-sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data. Furthermore, this extension features aggregate time series that depart significantly from permanent income behavior.

AB Household scale economies are plausibly attributed to shared household public goods that make larger households better off at the same level of per capita resources. Larger households should therefore have higher per capita consumption of private goods, such as food, provided that they do not substitute too much toward the effectively cheaper public goods. The evidence shows exactly the opposite. Data from rich and poor countries indicate that, at constant per capita total expenditure, the per capita demand for food decreases with household size and that it does so most in the poorest countries, where substitution should be the least.

As the cost of effort shrinks relative to payoffs, the optimal contract converges to a linear payoff if the control space of the agent has full dimensionality, but not otherwise. Thus, when the agent can trade expected return for greater correlation with other returns, it is better to ignore relative performance when the cost of effort is small. When the choices include all fair gambles and hedges, the linear schedule is no more expensive than any other schedule that induces effort. Unfair gambles are examined as well.

The empirical method uses a quasi-experimental survey design to correct for the bias from unobserved individual and village-level heterogeneity. We find that program credit has a larger effect on the behavior of poor households in Bangladesh when women are the program participants. For example, annual household consumption expenditure increases 18 taka for every 100 additional taka borrowed by women from these credit programs, compared with 11 taka for men.

The correlation holds for most measures of government spending, in low- as well as high-income samples, and is robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls. One explanation is that government spending plays a risk-reducing role in economies exposed to a significant amount of external risk. The paper provides a range of evidence consistent with this hypothesis. In particular, the relationship between openness and government size is strongest when terms-of-trade risk is highest.

AB It is argued that changes in workers' budget sets cannot explain the dramatic increases in civilian work in the United States during World War II. Although money wages grew during the period, wartime after-tax real wages were lower than either before or after the war. Evidence from the 1940s also appears to be inconsistent with other pecuniary explanations such as wealth effects of government policies, intertemporal substitution induced by asset prices, unfulfilled expectations, and changes in the nonmarket price of time. Although untested and relatively undeveloped, nonpecuniary models of behavior are tempting explanations for wartime work.

AB In estimating the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, Hall finds that, when one takes account of time aggregation, point estimates are small and not significantly different from zero. He concludes that the elasticity is unlikely to be much above 0.1 and may well be zero. Applying improved inference methods to an economic model similar to Hall's, Hansen and Singleton show that there is considerably less precision in the estimation. We argue that the model used by these authors is misspecified because the intratemporal substitution between nondurable consumption goods and durable consumption goods is ignored. We use a two-step procedure that combines a cointegration approach to preference parameter estimation with generalized method of moments to take these effects into account. Our estimates for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution are positive and significantly different from zero, even when time aggregation is taken into account.

ID INSURANCE; RISK
AB We examine the interactions between different institutional arrangements in a general equilibrium model of a modernizing economy. There is a modern sector, where productivity is high but information asymmetries are. large, and a traditional sector where productivity is low but information asymmetries are small. Consequently, agency costs in the modern sector make consumption lending difficult, while such lending is readily done in the traditional sector. The resulting trade-off between credit availability and productivity implies that not everyone will move to the modem sector. In fact, the laissez-faire level of modernization may fail to maximize net social surplus.
   This situation may also hold in the long run: in a dynamic version of the model, a "trickle-down" effect links the process of modernization with reduction in modern sector agency costs. This effect may be too weak and the economy may get stuck in a trap and never fully modernize. The two-sector structure also yields a natural theoretical testing ground for the Kuznets inverted-U hypothesis: we show that even within the "sectoral shifting" class of models, this phenomenon is not robust to small changes in model specification.

AB The marketing literature refers to the concept of brand capital and provides empirical evidence that firms with a large stock of well-established brands have an advantage in introducing new products. This paper develops a theory of brand extension as a mechanism for informational leverage in which a firm leverages off a good's reputation in one market to alleviate the problem of informational asymmetry encountered in other markets. It is shown that brand extension helps a multi-product monopolist introduce a new experience good with less price distortion. Thus, the paper provides a theoretical foundation for the concept of brand capital.

ID R-AND-D; RIGHTS
AB Empirical estimates of the private value of patent protection are derived for four technology areas-computers, textiles, combustion engines, and pharmaceuticals-using new patent data for West Germany, 1953-1988. Patentees must pay renewal fees to keep their patents in force as well as legal expenses in order to enforce them. A dynamic stochastic discrete choice model of optimal renewal decisions is developed incorporating both learning and depreciation as well as the potential need to prosecute infringement. The evolution of the distribution of returns over the life of a group of patents is calculated for each technology using a minimum distance simulation estimator. Results indicate that the aggregate value of protection generated per year is on the order of 10% of related R&D expenditure.

AB This paper examines the extent to which swings in stock prices can be related to variations in the discounted value of expected future dividends when investors face uncertainty about their future behaviour. I develop an econometric model that accounts for the instability of U.S. dividend growth and discount rates during the past 120 years. Estimates of the model reveal that changing forecasts of future dividend growth account for more than 90% of the predictable variations in dividend-prices. The estimates also imply that instability in the dividend and discount rate processes contribute significantly to the predictability of long-horizon stock returns.

ID CASCADES
AB This paper analyses a security market with transaction costs and a sequential trading structure. Transaction costs may prevent many traders from revealing their private information if they trade in a sequential fashion. Due to the information aggregation failure, hidden information gets accumulated in the market which may be revealed by a small trigger, yielding a high volatility in the absence of an accompanying event. The paper first characterizes the optimal trading strategy of the agent which constitute the unique equilibrium. Further properties of the price sequence are obtained using the concepts of informational cascade and informational avalanche.
   The results are applied to the explanation of market crashes. In particular, the dynamics of market crashes are illustrated as evolving through the following four phases: (1) boom; (2) euphoria; (3) trigger; and (4) panic; where the euphoria corresponds to the informational cascade and the panic corresponds to the informational avalanche.

AB The paper presents a model in which a population of agents repeatedly play games against nature; the rules of behaviour followed are revised over time through a process of imitation. For binary decisions, imitation selects rules consistent with a preference relation of the kind proposed by SSB utility theory and regret theory. In general, this preference relation need not satisfy either independence or transitivity; we state conditions on imitation necessary for it to do so. For decisions over three or more options, the long-run tendency is for options that are maximally preferred in terms of SSB preferences to be chosen. If no maximally preferred option exists, the process of imitation may not converge.

ID EVOLUTION
AB A "conventional" contract is a contract that each side of a bargain expects the other side to insist on, because it is standard and customary under the circumstances. We consider a process of convention formation in which agents' expectations evolve through repeated interactions in a large-population setting. Agents choose best replies given their knowledge of the precedents, subject to some inertia and random error in their choice behaviour. Over the long run, this adaptive learning process tends to select contracts that are efficient, and egalitarian in the sense that the payoffs are centrally located on the efficiency frontier of the payoff possibility set. When the payoffs form a convex, comprehensive bargaining set, the process selects the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution.

AB We study noncooperative multilateral bargaining games, based on underlying TU games, in which coalitions can renegotiate their agreements. We distinguish between models in which players continue to bargain after implementing agreements ("reversible actions") and models in which players who implement agreements must leave the game ("ineversible actions"). We show that renegotiation always results in formation of the grand coalition if actions are reversible, but that the process may otherwise end with smaller coalitions. On the other hand, we show that the grand coalition cannot form in one step if the core of the game is empty, irrespective of the reversibility of actions.

AB A reasonable model of the labour market over the business cycle should predict, among other things, that (a) in very low states of product demand there may be too little employment from an efficiency perspective, but as the state improves employment will increase until ultimately it is efficiently deployed, and (b) in low states of demand, a worker's welfare level will be "low" and as the state of the world improves so will the worker's welfare, except, possibly, at high levels of demand where the worker's utility may start to fan. Surprisingly, there does not exist a labour contract based model that is consistent with predictions (a) and (b). In fact, the standard results in the literature are if leisure is a normal good then there will be too much employment in essentially all states of the world and the welfare of the worker declines as the state of the world improves. In this paper a labour contracting model is constructed that is consistent with the above mentioned predictions. Two necessary ingredients in the model are the possibility of financial distress in low demand states and "partial provability" in contracting. Financial distress can be viewed as frustrating renegotiation and, thus, inefficient outcomes are possible in equilibrium. Partial provability-the ability of an informed player to make verifiable claims or statements to an uninformed player-eliminates certain kinds of inefficient outcomes. In particular, it eliminates the possibility that, in equilibrium, there is too much employment. This last result is interesting in itself because it is commonly believed that normality of leisure necessarily implies that labour contracting models will generate employment levels that are too high from an efficiency perspective.

ID PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS; MORAL HAZARD; INDIA; INSURANCE
AB Arrangements for achieving efficient risk-sharing vary depending on the information available to agents in the economy. The usual Euler equation restricts efficient allocations in an economy which obeys the permanent income hypothesis, while efficient allocations in an economy with private information and long-term contracts satisfy a symmetric restriction, but not the Euler equation. Full insurance arrangements are unique in that they satisfy both restrictions.
   We look at an environment in which it seems likely that long-term contracts play a role in mitigating the effects of private information: three village economies in South India. The evidence that consumption allocations satisfy the private information restriction is quite strong for households in two of the three villages; the evidence for the third village suggests that while consumption for some households satisfies the private information restrictions, other households' consumption obey the permanent income hypothesis.

Given the large capital stocks inherent in most ecological systems, the dynamic nature of most ecological change, and the dynamic response of markets, it is critical to build dynamic models to capture the resulting effects. This paper demonstrates how to construct such a model using the impacts of climate change on U.S. timber markets as an example. Across a wide range of scenarios and models, warming is predicted to expand timber supplies and thus benefit U.S. timber markets.

AB This paper examines the connection between layoffs, executive pay, and stock prices. Firms that announce layoffs in the previous year pay their CEOs more, and give their CEOs larger percentage raises than firms which do not have at least one layoff announcement in the previous year. However, the likelihood of announcing a layoff varies dramatically along other dimensions, for example firm size, which are also correlated with CEO pay. Once firm-specific fixed effects are controlled for, the CEO pay premium for laying off workers disappears. In addition, there is a small negative share price reaction to layoff announcements.

AB We study the relationship between asset prices and herd behavior, which occurs when traders follow the trend in past trades. When traders have private information on only a single dimension of uncertainty (the effect of a shock to the asset value), price adjustments prevent herd behavior. Herding arises when there are two dimensions of uncertainty (the existence and effect of a shock), but it need not distort prices because the market discounts the informativeness of trades during herding. With a third dimension of uncertainty (the quality of traders' information), herd behavior can lead to a significant, short-run mispricing.(JEL G12, G14, D83, D84).

AB In this paper we develop an applied general equilibrium model to examine the effects of tax-favored retirement accounts on the capital stock. The results from our benchmark model indicate that a modest IRA contribution limit similar to that in effect during the early 1980's raises the steady-state capital stock by 6.18 percent; approximately 9 percent of IRA contributions constitutes incremental saving. Our results lend support to recent suggestions that retirement accounts with favorable tax treatment only for contributions above some base amount might provide more stimulus to saving than conventional IRAs.

ID LIFE-CYCLE; CONSUMPTION
AB This paper addresses whether households save enough for their retirement. For successive date-of-birth cohorts we analyze income and expenditure patterns around the time of retirement. We find a fall in consumption as household heads retire which cannot be fully explained by a forward-looking consumption-smoothing model that accounts for expected demographic changes and mortality risk. Controlling for labor-market participation explains part, but not all, of this dip. We argue that the only way to reconcile fully the fall in consumption with the life-cycle hypothesis is with the systematic arrival of unexpected adverse information.

TI Education-finance reform and the distribution of education resources
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; UNITED-STATES; IMPACT
AB Between 1971 and 1996 opponents of local funding for public schools successfully challenged the constitutionality of school-finance systems in 16 states. Using the variation across states in the timing of these cases we investigate the impact of reform on the distribution of school resources. Our results suggest that court-ordered finance reform reduced within-state inequality in spending by 19 to 34 percent. Successful litigation reduced inequality by raising spending in the poorest districts while leaving spending in the richest districts unchanged thereby increasing aggregate spending on education. Reform led states to fund additional spending through higher state taxes.

ID SCHOOL QUALITY MATTER; EQUILIBRIUM; MOBILITY; RETURNS; GROWTH; MODELS
AB Many states are implementing school-finance reforms which will have complex effects on income distribution, intergenerational income mobility, and welfare. This paper analyzes the static and dynamic effects of such reforms by constructing a dynamic general equilibrium model of public-education provision and calibrating it using U.S. data. We examine the consequences of a reform of a locally financed system to a state-financed system which equalizes expenditures per student across districts. We find that this policy increases both average income and the share of income spent on education. Steady-state welfare increases by 3.2 percent of steady-state income.

Each player, rather than optimizing given a belief about the other players' behavior, as in the theory of Nash equilibrium, uses the following choice procedure. She first associates one consequence with each of her actions by sampling (literally or virtually) each of her actions once. Then she chooses the action that has the best consequence. We define a notion of equilibrium for such situations and study its properties.

It obtains some results which contradict findings by Grossman, Hart, and Moore. In particular, it finds that the loss of ownership of an asset may increase the asset loser's investment incentive. The difference between this paper and those authors' papers stems from the different interpretations of the roles of the threat point and outside options in bargaining, This paper also clarifies the role of relationship-specific investments as a cause of integration.

ID REPEATED GAMES; MORAL HAZARD; RENEGOTIATION; PERFORMANCE; RULES
AB Why are observed contracts so often incomplete in the sense that they leave contracting parties' obligations vague or unspecified? Traditional answers to this question invoke transaction costs or bounded rationality. In contrast, we argue that such incompleteness is often an essential feature of a well-designed contract. Specifically once some aspects of performance are unverifiable, it is often optimal to leave other verifiable aspects of performance unspecified. We explore the conditions under which this occurs, and investigate the structure of optimal contracts when these conditions are satisfied.

Using data from an experiment on a prototypical social program and data from nonexperimental comparison groups, we reject the assumptions justifying matching and our extensions of it. The evidence supports the selection bias model and the assumptions that justify a semiparametric version of the method of difference-in-differences. We extend our analysis to consider applications of the methods to ordinary observational data.

ID NONCAUSALITY; VECTORS; MODELS
AB Causality in the sense of Granger is typically defined in terms of predictibility of a vector of variables one period ahead. Recently, Lutkepohl (1993) proposed to define noncausality between two variables in terms of nonpredictibility at any number of periods ahead. When more than two vectors are considered (i.e., when the information set contains auxiliary variables), these two notions are not equivalent. In this paper, we first generalize the notion of causality by considering causality at a given (arbitrary) horizon h. Then we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for noncausality between vectors of variables (inside a larger vector) up to any given horizon h, where h can be infinite. In particular, for general possibly nonstationary processes with finite second moments, relatively simple exhaustivity and separation conditions, which are sufficient for noncausality at all horizons, are provided. To deal with cases where such conditions do not apply, we consider a more specific, although still very wide, class of vector autoregressive processes (possibly of infinite order, stationary or nonstationary), which include multivariate ARIMA processes, and we derive general parametric characterizations of noncausality at various horizons for this class (including a causality chain characterization). We also observe that the coefficients of lagged variables in forecasts at various horizons h greater than or equal to 1 can be interpreted as generalized impulse response coefficients which yield a complete picture of linear causality properties, in contrast with usual response coefficients which can be quite misleading in this respect.

AB This paper proposes a new statistical model for the analysis of data which arrive at irregular intervals. The model treats the time between events as a stochastic process and proposes a new class of point processes with dependent arrival rates. The conditional intensity is developed and compared with other self-exciting processes. Because the model focuses on the expected duration between events, it is called the autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model. Asymptotic properties of the quasi maximum likelihood estimator are developed as a corollary to ARCH model results. Strong evidence is provided for duration clustering for the financial transaction data analyzed; both deterministic time-of-day effects and stochastic effects are important. The model is applied to the arrival times of trades and therefore is a model of transaction volume, and also to the arrival of other events such as price changes. Models for the volatility of prices are estimated with price-based durations, and examined from a market microstructure point of view.

ID CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX; HETEROSKEDASTICITY
AB In a number of econometric models, rules of large-sample inference require a consistent estimate of f(0), where f(lambda) is the spectral density matrix of y(t) = u(t) x x(t), for covariance stationary vectors u(t), x(t). Typically y(t) is allowed to have nonparametric autocorrelation, and smoothing is used in the estimation of f(0). We give conditions under which f(0) can be consistently estimated without smoothing. The conditions are relevant to inference on slope parameters in models with an intercept and strictly exogenous regressors, and allow regressors and disturbances to collectively have considerable stationary long memory and to satisfy only mild, in some cases minimal, moment conditions. The estimate of f(0) dominates smoothed ones in the sense that it can have mean squared error of order n(-1), where n is sample size. Under standard additional regularity conditions, we extend the estimate of f(0) to studentize asymptotically normal estimates of structural parameters in linear simultaneous equations systems. A small Monte Carlo study of finite sample behavior is included.

AB In structural empirical models of labor market search, the distribution of wage offers is usually assumed to be exogenous. However, because in setting their wages profit-maximizing firms should consider the reservation wages of job seekers, the wage offer distribution is essentially endogenous. We investigate whether a proposed equilibrium search model, in which the wage offer distribution is endogenous, is able to describe observed labor market histories. We find that the distributions of job and unemployment spells are consistent with the data, and that the qualitative predictions of the model for the wages set by employers are confirmed by wage regressions. The model is estimated using panel data on unemployed and employed individuals. We distinguish between separate segments of the labor market, and we show that productivity heterogeneity is important to obtain an acceptable fit to the data. The results are used to estimate the degree of monopsony power of firms. Further, the effects of changes in the mandatory minimum wage are examined.

AB A long tradition in economics assumes that any potential gains from trade will be exploited. This emphasis on efficiency clashes with the possibility that hard bargaining over the division of the surplus may cause some potential deals to be lost. We examine an Outside Option Game designed to study the tension between maximising the size of the surplus and bargaining over the division of this surplus among those who contributed to its creation. An experimental study confirms that subjects often fail to achieve efficient outcomes. A theoretical model accounts for this behaviour in terms of an equilibrium achieved in an imperfect world.

AB We study the politics of intergenerational redistribution in an overlapping generations model with short-lived governments. The successive governments-who care about the welfare of the currently living generations and possibly about campaign contributions-are unable to pre-commit the future course of redistributive taxation. In a stationary politicoeconomic equilibrium, the intergenerational transfer in each period depends on the current value of the state variable and all expectations about future political outcomes are fulfilled. We find that there exist multiple stationary equilibria in many political settings. Steady-state welfare is often lower than it would be in the absence of redistributive politics.

We present the history of the scheme and use a 1993 nationally representative survey to investigate the redistributive consequences of the transfers, documenting who receive the pensions, their levels of living, and those of their families. We also look at behavioural effects, particularly the effects of the cash receipts on the allocation of income to food, schooling, transfers, and savings.

AB The common ratio effect is a well-attested violation of expected utility theory. This paper uses four principles of dynamic choice to characterise alternative theoretical strategies for explaining the effect. It reports an experiment which tests these principles and, by implication, several well-known accounts of the common ratio effect. Unlike previous work, the experimental design uses real financial incentives without presupposing any dynamic choice principles. We find violation of a principle of 'timing independence', which is part of most existing theories of dynamic choice. We examine the implications of this finding for decision theory and economics.

AB We consider an economy where contracts are necessary to encourage investments. Contract enforcement requires that a fraction of the agents work in the public sector and do not accept bribes. We find that: (1) It may be optimal to allow some corruption and not enforce property rights fully. (2) Less developed economies may choose lower levels of property right enforcement and more corruption. (3) There may exist a 'free-lunch' such that over a certain range it is possible simultaneously to reduce corruption, increase investment, and achieve a better allocation of talent.

AB We study in this paper a simple alternative to price cap regulation. The mechanism, which ive label 'output floor' regulation, requires the regulated firm to supply a given level of output. This rule is as simple as price cap regulation, and performs identically when the regulated firm is a natural monopoly; however, we show that, in the presence of a competitive fringe, output floor regulation yields lower prices and stronger incentives for cost reduction. Its introduction, however, is likely to be resisted by the industry, since it lowers managerial utility and shareholders' profits.

AB Microeconomically, the case for liberalisation is dubious under increasing returns to scale and when firms can invest directly in productivity enhancement. Distributional effects of commercial policy changes can be regressive and large, but the 'rents' they generate can serve as a basis for effective policy intervention contingent on firms' performance. Macroeconomically, the case of liberalisation rests on Say's Law, which is not always enforced. Recent combined current and capital market liberalisations have been associated with strong exchange rates and high interest rates and output and productivity growth have positive mutual feedbacks which liberalisation may well suppress.

AB This paper provides new evidence that state policies play a role in the location of industry. The paper classifies a state as probusiness if it has a right-to-work law and antibusiness if it does not. The paper finds that, on average, there is a large, abrupt increase in manufacturing activity when one crosses a state border from an antibusiness state into a probusiness state.

ID IRAS
AB This paper examines the extent to which households offset pension wealth with reductions in other wealth. Systematic econometric biases imply that the estimated offsets in previous empirical studies are smaller than the true offset and may even have the wrong sign. New empirical estimates that do not correct for the biases generate little offset between pensions and other wealth. Estimates that correct for the biases show substantially more offset (a smaller impact of pensions on overall saving) than in most previous studies. The estimates also indicate that the effects of pensions on wealth vary significantly across households.

   LABOR; WAGES; RENTS
AB Specific quasi rents arise in a variety of economic relationships and are exposed to opportunism unless fully protected by contract. Rent appropriation has important macroeconomic consequences. Resources are underutilized, factor markets are segmented, production suffers from technological "sclerosis," job creation and destruction are unbalanced, recessions are excessively sharp, and expansions run into bottlenecks. While, depending on the shock, expansions may require reinforcement or stabilization, recessions should typically be softened. In the long run, institutions may evolve to alleviate the problem by balancing appropriation. Technology choice will also be affected, with the appropriated factor partially "excluding" the other from production to reduce appropriation.

We fail to reject the hypothesis of rationality as long as we take into account two complications: (1) the correlation in a given period of analysts' forecast errors in predicting earnings for firms in the same industry and (2) discretionary asset write-downs, which affect earnings but are intentionally ignored by analysts when they make earnings forecasts. Our results challenge earlier work by De Bondt and Thaler and by Abarbanell and Bernard that found irrationality in analysts' forecasts.

ID COSTS; GAMES
AB The winner-take-all nature of all-pay auctions makes the outcome sensitive to decision errors, which we introduce with a legit formulation. The equilibrium bid distribution is a fixed point: the belief distributions that determine expected payoffs equal the choice distributions determined by expected payoffs. We prove existence, uniqueness, and symmetry properties. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, the comparative statics of the legit equilibrium are intuitive: rent dissipation increases with the number of players and the bid cost. Overdissipation of rents is impossible under full rationality but is observed in laboratory experiments. Our model predicts this property.

AB A common view is that there is little correlation between firm performance and CEO pay. Using a new fifteen-year panel data set of CEOs in the largest, publicly traded U. S. companies, we document a strong relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation. This relationship is generated almost entirely by changes in the value of CEO holdings of stock and stock options. In addition, we show that both the level of CEO compensation and the sensitivity of compensation to firm performance have risen dramatically since 1980, largely because of increases in stock option grants.

AB Current concern with the impact of new technologies on the wage structure motivates this study. We offer evidence that technology-skill and capital-skill (relative) complementarities existed in manufacturing early in this century and were related to the adoption of electric motors and particular production methods. Industries, from 1909 to 1929, with more capital per worker and a greater proportion of motive energy coming from purchased electricity employed relatively more educated blue-collar workers in 1940 and paid their production workers substantially more. We also find a strong positive association between changes in capital intensity and the nonproduction worker wage bill from 1909-1919 implying capital-skill complementarity as large as in recent years.

AB The more liquid a firm's assets, the greater their value in a short-notice liquidation. It is generally thought that a firm should find it easier to raise external finance against more liquid assets. This paper focuses on the dark side of liquidity: greater asset liquidity reduces the firm's ability to commit to a specific course of action. As a result, greater asset liquidity can, in some circumstances, reduce the firm's capacity to raise external finance. Firms with "excessively'' liquid assets are in the best position to finance illiquid projects. This leads us to a theory of financial intermediation and disintermediation based on the liquidity of assets.

AB Why are many of China's successful rural enterprises publically owned by local communities? Using a set of provincial data, we find that the share of community public firms (Township-Village Enterprises, or TVEs) relative to private enterprises is higher where the central government's influence is greater, the community government's power is stronger, and the level of market development is lower. We also find that TVEs help achieve the community government's goals of increasing government revenue, rural nonfarm employment, and rural income. However, TVEs do not increase rural income given the levels of nonfarm employment and local public goods provision, indicating possible inefficiency as compared with private enterprises.

An explanation for this finding based on the interaction between (S, s)-type adjustment and trend employment growth delivers some tight predictions for the relationship between trend growth and the volatility of creation relative to destruction. Although it scores some notable successes, the simple (S, s)-based model augmented with a low-frequency trend cannot fully account for the strength of the empirical relationship between relative gross-flow volatility and trend growth across one-digit industries.

AB Do firms become more efficient after becoming exporters? Do exporters generate positive externalities for domestically oriented producers? In this paper we tackle these questions by analyzing the causal links between exporting and productivity using plant-level data. We look for evidence that firms' cost processes change after they break into foreign markets. We find that relatively efficient firms become exporters; however, in most industries, firms' costs are not affected by previous exporting activities. So the well-documented positive association between exporting and efficiency is explained by the self-selection of the more efficient firms into the export market. We also find some evidence of positive regional externalities.

The debt-GDP ratio displays mean-reversion if one controls for war-time spending and for cyclical fluctuations. The positive response of the primary surplus to changes in debt also shows that U.

In this paper we show that indexes of social development constructed in the early 1960s have considerable predictive power. These results indicate the importance of "social capability'' for economic growth. We emphasize that social arrangements matter for reasons beyond those discussed in recent work on trust and social capital. However, we are also able to show that one of the indexes may be a useful proxy for social capital in developing countries.

ID MONOPOLY; EXPLORATION; QUALITY; DESIGN
AB We provide existence proofs and characterization results for the multidimensional version of the multiproduct monopolist problem of Mussa and Rosen (1978). These results are also directly applicable to the multidimensional nonlinear pricing problems studied by Wilson (1993) and Armstrong (1996). We establish that bunching is robust in these multidimensional screening problems, even with very regular distributions of types. This comes from a strong conflict between participation constraints and second order incentive compatibility conditions. We consequently design a new technique, the sweeping procedure, for dealing with bunching in multidimensional contexts. This technique extends the ironing procedure of Mussa and Rosen (1978) to several dimensions. We illustrate it on two examples: we first solve a linear quadratic version of the bidimensional nonlinear pricing problem, where consumers' types are exponentially distributed. The solution involves pure bundling for consumers with low demands. The second example is the bidimensional version of the Mussa and Rosen problem when consumers' types are uniformly distributed on a square. The solution is such that the seller offers a full differentiation of products in the upper part of the qualities spectrum, but only limited choice for lower qualities. This seems to be a quite general pattern for multidimensional screening problems. The sweeping procedure is potentially applicable to other multidimensional screening problems.

AB The 1980's tax reforms and the changing dispersion of wages offer one of the best opportunities yet to estimate labor supply effects. Nevertheless, changing sample composition, aggregate shocks, the changing composition of the tax paying population, and discontinuities in the tax system create serious identification and estimation problems. We develop grouping estimators that address these issues. Our results reveal positive and moderately sized wage elasticities. We: also find negative income effects for women with children.

AB The method of simulated scores (MSS) is presented for estimating limited dependent variables models (LDV) with flexible correlation structure in the unobservables. We propose simulators that are continuous in the unknown parameter vectors, and hence standard optimization methods can be used to compute the MSS estimators that employ these simulators. The first continuous method relies on a recursive conditioning of the multivariate normal density through a Cholesky triangularization of its variance-covariance matrix. The second method combines results about the conditionals of the multivariate normal distribution with Gibbs resampling techniques. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the MSS estimators and derive suitable rates at which the number of simulations must rise if biased simulators are used.

ID MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; ECONOMIES
AB We examine the welfare properties of surplus maximization by embedding;perfectly discriminating monopoly in an otherwise standard Arrow-Debreu economy. Although we discover an inefficient equilibrium, we validate partial equilibrium intuition by showing: (i) that equilibria are efficient provided that the monopoly goods are costly, and (ii) that a natural monopoly can typically use personalized two-part tariffs in these equilibria. However, we find that Pareto optima are sometimes incompatible with surplus maximization, even when transfer payments are used. We provide insight into the source of this difficulty and give some,instructive examples of economies where a second welfare theorem holds.

ID GOVERNMENT; POOR
AB A fiscal programme that redistributes income from rich to poor individuals indirectly redistributes tax revenues from regions hit by a favourable shock to regions hit by an unfavourable one. Centralised fiscal redistribution has therefore been advocated as a way to insure individuals against region-specific shocks. In this paper, we argue that a centralised fiscal policy, while reducing the uncertainty on the tax base, may create additional uncertainty on the tax rate. Using a simple model we show that the higher uncertainty on the policy instrument might more than offset the lower uncertainty on the tax base.

AB A country's suitability for entry into a currency union depends on a number of economic conditions. These include, inter alia, the intensity of trade with other potential members of the currency union, and the extent to which domestic business cycles are correlated with those of the other countries. But international trade patterns and international business cycle correlations are endogenous. This paper develops and investigates the relationship between the two phenomena. Using thirty years of data for twenty industrialised countries, we uncover a strong and striking empirical finding: countries with closer trade links tend to have more rightly correlated business cycles.

ID PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS; RISK; CONSTITUTIONS
AB This paper looks at theoretical and empirical issues associated with the operation of fiscal stabilisers within an economy. It argues that such stabilisers operate most effectively at a national, rather than local, level. As differing cycles across regions tend to offset each other for the country as a whole, national fiscal stabilisers are not associated with the same increase in future tax liabilities for the region as local ones. Accordingly, the negative impact from the Ricardian effects associated with these tax liabilities is smaller. Empirical, work on data across Canadian provinces indicates that local stabilisers are only 1/3 to 1/2 as effective as national stabilisers which create no future tax liability.

We compare empirical implications for the relation between option prices and the spot's position within the band for three classes of target zone models: those with full credibility, those with exogenous realignment risk, and those with endogenous realignment risk. Empirically, implied volatility from these options attains a maximum near the edges of an exchange rate band rather than its centre even three to six months prior to realignment.

AB This paper considers the causes of post-war UK business cycles. Using an extended stochastic growth model we construct estimates of productivity and preference shock; both of which are highly persistent, volatile and potentially capable of explaining UK business cycles. We find the productivity term is the dominant explanation of UK output fluctuations but our estimated preference shift is crucial in understanding employment movements. A variety of Granger causality tests establish whether these productivity and preference terms are unpredictable and so can be potentially considered as the cause of UK business cycles or whether they are themselves Granger caused by other variables.

It is shown that, without direct monitoring of quality or effort to reduce costs, such contracts are efficient only when it is efficient to treat all patients wanting treatment. It may not be when treatment costs are insured or subsidised. Such contracts can then be improved by including payments for the number of patients wanting treatment, as well as for the number actually treated. Even then, the outcome will not generally be efficient if quality is multi-dimensional.

AB Benchmark measures of trade restrictiveness using the Trade Restrictiveness Index stand in sharp contrast to standard measures. For a 27 country sample, trade weighted average tariffs under-estimate restrictiveness measured by the 'uniform tariff equivalent' (the inverse of the TRI minus one) by an average of 50%. For a 7 case sample of changes in trade policy, the TRI and changes in average tariffs are uncorrelated. These conclusions appear to be robust with respect to missing data problems and to elasticity of substitution variation, but may be sensitive to the assumptions used to treat NTBs.

Well over a hundred regional arrangements, involving most nations, now exist. Deja vu: the 1950s and 1960s had likewise witnessed many 'old regionalism' initiatives. Except for Western Europe, these in the end amounted to little, however, and efforts for preferential trade became quiescent, until the dramatic advent of the 'new regionalism'.

AB In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are exploited to provide a unified, practical likelihood-based framework for the analysis of stochastic volatility models. A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.

AB This paper develops methods for constructing asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the date of a single break in multivariate time series, including I(0), I(1), and deterministically trending regressors. Although the width of the asymptotic confidence interval does not decrease as the sample size increases, it is inversely related to the number of series which have a common break date, so there are substantial gains to multivariate inference about break dates. These methods are applied to two empirical examples: the mean growth rate of output in three European countries, and the mean growth rate of U.S. consumption, investment, and output.

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE MODELS; CALIBRATION; POLICY; BOOTSTRAP; OUTPUT; GROWTH
AB We propose a constructive, multivariate framework for assessing agreement between (generally misspecified) dynamic equilibrium models and data, which enables a complete second-order comparison of the dynamic properties of models and data. We use bootstrap algorithms to evaluate the significance of deviations between models and data, and we use goodness-of-fit criteria to produce estimators that optimize economically-relevant loss functions. We provide a detailed illustrative application to modelling the U.S. cattle cycle.

ID SUPPLY DISTURBANCES; AGGREGATE DEMAND; ARBITRAGE; DIFFUSION; COMMON;
   TRENDS
AB This paper develops a method for analysing the dynamics of large cross-sections based on a factor analytic model. We use "law of large numbers" arguments to show that the number of common factors can be determined by a principal components method, the economy-wide shocks can be identified by means of simple structural VAR techniques and that the parameters of the unobserved factor model can be estimated consistently by applying OLS equation by equation. We distinguish between a technological and a non-technological shock. Identification is obtained by minimizing the negative realizations of the technology shock. Empirical results on 4-digit industrial output and productivity for the U.S. economy from 1958 to 1986 show that: (1) at least two economy-wide shocks, both having a long-run effect on sectoral output, are needed to explain the common dynamics; (2) although the technological shock accounts for at least 50% of the aggregate dynamics of output, it cannot by itself explain dynamics at business cycle frequencies; (3) sector-specific shocks explain the main bulk of total variance but generate mainly high frequency dynamics; (4) both the technological and the non-technological component of output show a peak for positive sectoral comovements of output at business cycle frequencies; (5) technological shocks are strongly correlated with the growth rates of the investment in machinery and equipment sectors and their inputs.

AB There is frequently interest in testing that a scalar or vector time series is I(0), possibly after first-differencing or other detrending, while the I(0) assumption is also taken for granted in autocorrelation-consistent variance estimation. We propose a test for I(0) against fractional alternatives. The test is nonparametric, and indeed makes no assumptions on spectral behaviour away from zero frequency. It seems likely to have good efficiency against fractional alternatives, relative to other nonparametric tests. The test is given large sample justification, subjected to a Monte Carlo analysis of finite sample behaviour, and applied to various empirical data series.

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

DT Article
ID RANK CORRELATION ESTIMATOR; REGRESSION
AB This paper provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for the intercept of a semiparametrically estimated sample selection model. The estimator uses a decreasingly small fraction of all observations as the sample size goes to infinity, as in Heckman (1990). In the semiparametrics literature, estimation of the intercept has typically been subsumed in the nonparametric sample selection bias correction term. The estimation of the intercept, however, is important from an economic perspective. For instance, it permits one to determine the "wage gap" between unionized and nonunionized workers, decompose the wage differential between different socioeconomic groups (e.g. male-female and black-white), and evaluate the net benefits of a social programme.

ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; CAPITAL STOCK; CURRENCY; MONEY
AB This article presents a monetary growth model where spatial separation and limited communication create a role for banks. Monetary policy interacts with the financial system's liquidity provision to affect the existence, multiplicity, and dynamical properties of equilibria. Moderate levels of risk aversion and tight monetary policy can lead to multiple steady states. Dynamical equilibria can be indeterminate, with oscillatory paths. Thus financial market frictions are a source of indeterminacies and endogenous volatility. Under plausible conditions, tight monetary policy raises the nominal interest rate and inflation rate and reduces long run output. Thus, a central bank's liquidity provision can promote growth.

ID IN-ADVANCE ECONOMY; EQUITY PREMIUM; MONEY; GROWTH; PUZZLE
AB We examine the characteristics of optimal monetary policies in a general equilibrium model with incomplete markets. Markets are incomplete because of uninsured preference uncertainty, and because productive capital is traded infrequently. Rational individuals are willing to hold a liquid asset-"money"-at a premium. Monetary policy interacts with existing financial institutions to determine this premium, as well as the level of precautionary holdings. We show that inflation is expansionary, and that the optimal inflation rate is positive if there is no operative banking system (the Tobin effect). Otherwise, efficiency requires that money be undominated in its rate of return (the Friedman Rule).

   DELAY; UNCERTAINTY; GAMES
AB I study alternating-offer bargaining games with two-sided incomplete information about the players' discount rates. For both perfect Bayesian equilibrium and a rationalizability-style notion, I characterize the set of expected payoffs which may arise in the game. I also construct bounds on agreements that may be made. The set of expected payoffs is easy to compute and incorporate into applied models. My main result is a full characterization of the set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium payoffs for games in which the distribution over the players' discount rates is of wide support, yet is in a weak sense close to a point mass distribution. I prove a lopsided convergence result: each player cannot gain from a slight chance that she is a strong type, but the player can suffer greatly if there is a slight chance that she is a weak type.

TI Learning from neighbours
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB When payoffs from different actions are unknown, agents use their own past experience as well as the experience of their neighbours to guide their decision making. In this paper, we develop a general framework to study the relationship between the structure of these neighbourhoods and the process of social learning.
   We show that, in a connected society, local learning ensures that all agents obtain the same payoffs in the long run. Thus, if actions have different payoffs, then all agents choose the same action, and social conformism obtains. We develop conditions on the distribution of prior beliefs, the structure of neighbourhoods and the informativeness of actions under which this action is optimal. In particular, we identify a property of neighbourhood structures-local independence-which greatly facilitates social learning. Simulations of the model generate spatial and temporal patterns of adoption that are consistent with empirical work.

ID GAME
AB We use a two-period matching model with initial uncertainty about productivities of participants to analyze incentives for early contracting or unraveling. Unraveling provides insurance in the absence of complete markets, but causes inefficient assignments. Unraveling is more likely the smaller the applicant pool, the smaller the proportion of more-promising applicants, and the greater the heterogeneity in the pool. Banning early contracts hurts firms and benefits less-promising applicants; the effects on more-promising applicants depend on how the gains from early contracts are shared. Ex post buyouts eliminate inefficient assignments, and more-promising applicants always unravel.

AB Many workers receive pay based on subjectively assessed performance, yet the shirking model of efficiency wages excludes it. This paper incorporates such pay, with the following results. Performance pay is more efficient than efficiency wages when the costs of having a job vacant are low and qualified workers in short supply. More capital-intensive industries pay more than less capital-intensive industries, as observed in studies of interindustry wages differentials. Sustaining an efficient outcome requires a social convention similar to the notion of a fair wage. The model also makes predictions about the relationship between turnover, wages, growth, and unemployment.

ID HOUSEHOLD
AB If child labor as a mass phenomenon occurs not because of parental selfishness but because of the parents' concern for the household's survival, the popular argument for banning child labor loses much of its force. However, this assumption about parental decision-making coupled with the assumption of substitutability in production between child and adult labor could result in multiple equilibria in the labor market, with one equilibrium where children work and another where adult wage is high and children do not work. The paper establishes this result and discusses its policy implications.

ID ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; STRIKES; MODEL
AB Holdouts (the continuation of negotiations beyond the contract expiry date) are the most common form of disputes in labor contract negotiations. We model holdouts as a delaying tactic employed by unions to obtain information about other bargaining outcomes in their industry. Novel implications of our model include a positive association between holdout duration and the number of bargaining pairs negotiating contracts simultaneously; bunching of holdout durations within these "negotiating groups"; and fewer strikes among holdouts which end later in groups. Using a large panel of contract negotiations in Canadian manufacturing, we find considerable support for these predictions.

ID NATURAL EXPERIMENT; MODEL; WORK; FERTILITY; MOTHERHOOD; QUANTITY;
   BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; INCOME; BIRTHS
AB Research on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated by the endogeneity of fertility. This study uses parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition to construct instrumental variables (IV) estimates of the effect of childbearing on labor supply. IV estimates for women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates. The IV are also smaller for more educated women and show no impact of family size on husbands' labor supply. A comparison of estimates using sibling-sex composition and twins instruments implies that the impact of a third child disappears when the child reaches age 13.

AB I consider trade between a flexible-wage America and a rigid-wage Europe. In a benchmark case, a move from autarky to free trade doubles European unemployment. American wages rise to the European level. Entry of the unskilled "South" to world markets raises European unemployment. Europe's commitment to the high wage wholly insulates America from the shock. Immigration to America raises American income, but lowers European income dollar for dollar, while European unemployment rises. Absent South-North migration of the unskilled from 1970-1990, Europe could have maintained the same wage with from one-eighth to one-fourth less unemployment.

AB We construct a rational expectations model in which the economy switches stochastically between periods of low and high growth. When agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on investment are low and little investment takes place. But if agents expect fast growth, investment is high, returns are high, and growth is rapid. This expectational indeterminacy is induced by monopolistic competition and complementarity between different types of capital goods. Neither externalities nor increasing returns to scale are required. The equilibrium with growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a simple learning rule.

The presence of adverse selection creates an indeterminacy of equilibrium, Many equilibria display permanent fluctuations characterized by transitions between Walrasian regimes and regimes of credit rationing. Cyclical contractions involve declines in real interest rates, increases in credit rationing, and withdrawals of savings from banks. For some configurations of parameters all equilibria display cyclical fluctuations. We provide sufficient conditions for deterministic cycles consisting of m periods of expansion followed by n periods of contraction to exist.

AB Do well-functioning stock markets and banks promote long-run economic growth? This paper shows that stock market liquidity and banking development both positively predict growth, capital accumulation, and productivity improvements when entered together in regressions, even after controlling for economic and political factors. The results are consistent with the views that financial markets provide important services for growth, and that stock markets provide different services from banks. The paper also finds that stock market size, volatility, and international integration are not robustly linked with growth, and that none of the financial indicators is closely associated with private saving rates.

Specifically, we ask whether industrial sectors that are relatively more in need of external finance develop disproportionately faster in countries with more-developed financial markets. We find this to be true in a large sample of countries over the 1980's. We show this result is unlikely to be driven by omitted variables, outliers, or reverse causality.

This unique equilibrium depends not only on the fundamentals, but also on financial variables, such as the quantity of hot money in circulation and the costs of speculative trading. In contrast to multiple equilibrium models, our model allows analysis of policy proposals directed at curtailing currency attacks.

AB To test whether naturally occurring markets can be strategically manipulated, $500 and $1,000 bets were made, then canceled, at horse racing tracks. The net effects of these costless temporary bets give clues about how market participants react to information large bets might contain. The bets moved odds on horses visibly (compared to matched-pair control horses with similar prebet odds) and had a slight tendency to draw money toward the horse that was temporarily bet, but the net effect was close to zero and statistically insignificant. The results suggest that some betters inferred information from bets and others did not, and their reactions roughly canceled out.

AB This paper examines lending by a Genoese-led cartel to Philip II of Spain (1556-98) from the perspective of theory on sovereign debt. Models in this literature suggest that the Genoese linked specie deliveries from Spain to the Lo cv Countries to lending in order to create a penalty to enforce their loans. The king tried to renege, the Genoese applied the penalty, and the king ultimately repaid. When the episode is used to examine theory, the Crown's observed debt ceiling and estimates of its cost of enduring the penalty and its ability to repay are in line with predictions of Bulow and Rogoff The nature of the penalty has the flavor of Cole and Kehoe's model; its observation on the "path of play" is suggestive of Atkeson's model.

We impute the higher unemployment to welfare states' diminished ability to cope with more turbulent economic limes, such as the ongoing restructuring from manufacturing to the service industry, adoption of new information technologies, and a rapidly changing international economy. We use a general equilibrium search model in which workers accumulate skills on the job and lose skills during unemployment.

AB This paper analyzes the savings and longevity impacts of mortality-contingent claims, defined here as income measures, such as annuities and life insurance, under which earned income is contingent on the length of one's life. The postwar increase in mandatory annuity and life insurance programs, as well as the rapid increase in the life expectancy of older ages, motivates a better understanding of the incentive effects that mortality-contingent claims have on longevity-related behavior. We claim that these incentives often alter the standard conclusions obtained about old-age support when mortality is treated exogenously. In particular, we argue that annuities involve moral hazard effects that increase longevity and, among other things, introduce a positive interaction between public programs for health care and income support for the elderly-programs that have grown enormously in developed countries.

ID PROTECTION
AB An argument often heard in favor of trade agreements is that, by committing to free trade, a government can credibly distance itself from domestic lobbies. But several existing models of endogenous protection suggest that governments have no interest in foreclosing interest group pressures since governments derive rents from the political process. We develop a small-country model in which factors are sector-specific in the short run but mobile in the long run. We show that in this setting a government may be worse off in the political equilibrium than under commitment to free trade, and hence it may value a trade agreement.

LA English
DT Article
ID LAW; RESTRICTIONS; EFFICIENCY
AB Regulating insider trading lessens the adverse selection problem facing market makers, enabling them to quote better prices. An optimal enforcement policy must balance these benefits against the costs of enforcement. Such a policy must specify (i) the conditions under which the regulator conducts an investigation, (ii) the penalty schedule imposed if an insider is caught, and (iii) a transaction tax to fund enforcement. We derive the policy that maximizes investors' welfare. This policy entails investigations following large trading volumes or large price movements or both. Insiders caught making large trades are assessed the maximum penalty, hut small trades are not penalized. Given this policy, insiders trade most aggressively on news with an intermediate price impact but refrain from trading on moderate or extreme news.

AB This is the first systematic experimental study of the comparative performance of two incentive-compatible mechanisms for public goods provision: the basic quadratic mechanism by Groves and Ledyard and the paired-difference mechanism by Walker. Our experiments demonstrate that the performance of the basic quadratic mechanism under a high punishment parameter is far better than that of the same mechanism under a low punishment parameter, which, in turn, is better than that of the paired-difference mechanism. We estimate three individual behavioral models: an exponentialized relative payoff sum model outperforms the generalized fictitious play model. We also provide a sufficient condition for convergence under the basic quadratic mechanism.

AB Discussions of modern scientific research's organization point to the 19th-century emergence of German research universities as evidence that state investment in nondirected academic research, when coupled with beneficial relations between academic research and industry, and when stimulated by appropriate incentives such as protection of intellectual property in an open, competitive system, can lead to explosive growth in scientific knowledge and rapid improvement of industry. This paper examines three episodes in the evolution of Germany's research system pointing to the roles of state interests and innovative ministerial leadership in fashioning the research system to meet state needs.

AB A probability weighting function w(p) is a prominent feature of several non-expected utility theories, including prospect theory and rank-dependent models. Empirical estimates indicate that w(p) is regressive (first w(p)>p, then w(p)<p), s-shaped (first concave, then convex), and asymmetrical (intersecting the diagonal at about 1/3). The paper states axioms for several w(p) forms, including the compound invariant, w(p)= exp{-{-ln p}(alpha)}, 0 < alpha < 1, which is regressive, s-shaped, and with an invariant fixed point and inflection point at 1/e = .37.

   We apply our methods to estimate models of the conditional volatility of the daily returns of the SEP 500 Cash Index series. In contrast to QML estimators, our proposed method resists outliers, revealing an informative new picture of volatility dynamics during "typical" daily market activity.

SO ECONOMETRICA

DE bargaining games; experimental design; learning
ID BEHAVIOR; RISK; EXPECTATIONS
AB This paper reports an experiment involving an ultimatum bargaining game, prayed in the Slovak Republic. Financial stakes were varied by a factor of 25, and behavior was observed both when player; were inexperienced and as they gained experience. Consistent with prior results, changes in stakes had only a small effect on play for inexperienced players. But the present experimental design allows us to observe that rejections were less frequent the higher the stakes, and proposals in the high stakes conditions declined slowly as subjects gained experience. This Slovak experiment is the first to detect a lower frequency of rejection when stakes are higher and this can be explained by the added power due to multiple observations per subject in the experimental design. A model of learning suggests that the lower rejection frequency is the reason that the proposers in the higher stakes conditions of the ultimatum game learn to make lower offers.

DE repeated games; imperfect private monitoring; delayed communication
ID FOLK THEOREM; INFORMATION; EQUILIBRIA
AB This paper examines repeated games in which each player observes a private and imperfect signal on the actions played, and in which players are allowed to communicate using public messages. Providing incentives for players to reveal their observations generates (revelation) constraints that, combined with signal imperfections, may be a source of inefficiencies. However, by delaying the revelation of their observations, players may economize on the cost of deterring deviations, and thereby avoid these inefficiencies.
   Because a player would not want to trigger a sanction that would penalize him too, revelation constraints also tend to make sanctions difficult to enforce. However, with at least three players, detecting deviations may not require that all the players reveal their observations. In that case, we obtain a Nash threat Version of the Folk theorem. With two players, we do not obtain a similar result. Nevertheless, we show that an efficient outcome can (almost) always be approximated.

AB We examine the possibility of cooperation in a long term relationship, where agents receive diverse imperfect information about each other's actions. "Secret price cutting" in the industrial organization literature is a leading example. In a differentiated product market, a firm cannot directly observe rival firms' secret price cutting, but its own sales can imperfectly indicate what is going on. Since the firms' sales levels are subject to random shocks, they may well end up having diverse expectations: firms with low sales may suspect price cutting while others may not. This causes a serious difficulty in sustaining collusion in such a market. In fact, the characterization of equilibria of this class of games-discounted repeated games where each player receives a different signal -has been an open question, despite the large body of literature on repeated games. The present paper shows that communication is a powerful way of resolving the possible confusion among the players in this class of games. In particular, we construct equilibria where players voluntarily communicate what they have observed and prove folk theorems. Our results thus provide a theoretical support for the conventional wisdom that communication plays an important role in sustaining collusion.

DE censored quantile regression; kernel estimation; linear programming;

ID WAGE STRUCTURE; MONTE-CARLO
AB The paper introduces an alternative estimator for the linear censored quantile regression model. The objective function is globally convex and the estimator is a solution to a linear programming problem. Hence, a global minimizer is obtained in a finite number of simplex iterations. The suggested estimator also applies to the case where the censoring point is an unknown function of a set of regressors. It is shown that, under fairly weak conditions, the estimator has a root n-convergence rate and is asymptotically normal. In the case of a fixed censoring point, its asymptotic property is nearly equivalent to that of the estimator suggested by Powell (1984, 1986a). A Monte Carlo study performed shows that the suggested estimator has very desirable small sample properties. It precisely corrects for the bias induced by censoring, even when there is a large amount of censoring, and for relatively small sample sizes.

Two scenarios are considered: (i) the case of a symmetric, unregulated industry, and (ii) the case of an industry with a dominant, regulated incumbent In the first, provided there is sufficient product differentiation, it is shown that firms agree to set interconnection charges above associated costs in order to obtain the joint profit-maximising outcome. In the second a formula for the welfare-maximizing interconnection charge is derived. Relations with the 'efficient component pricing rule' are discussed.

AB In 1989, the United Kingdom Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) recommended measures that eventually led brewers to divest themselves of 14,000 public houses. The MMC claimed that their recommendations would lower retail prices and increase consumer choice. Since that time, however, retail prices have risen. This paper contains an econometric analysis of the transition period. The analysis is based on a model of the relationship between retail price and retail-organisational form that emphasises how exclusive-dealing clauses and strategic factors interact.

AB In the late 1980s, Norway's labour market experienced similar supply and demand shifts for skills to other countries', but unlike other OECD nations, Norway's wage setting system became more centralised. The pay distribution in Norway became more compressed at the bottom from 1987 to 1991, while low wage workers in other countries lost ground relatively. Using Norwegian microdata for 1987 and 1991, I found that changing labour market prices helped cause this wage compression. Further, the less educated had declining relative overall employment but increasing relative public sector employment, both possible labour market responses to the wage compression.

AB Selective search where unemployed job losers confine their job seeking efforts to matches in the pre-separation sector has attracted considerable attention as a possible source of high and persistent unemployment. However, this idea is questionable. Those opting for selection may do so because this strategy is more effective at generating an acceptable offer. Using UK microdata I find evidence in support of the latter view. Selective searchers cannot account for the persistence of high unemployment since the early 1980s.

TI Black markets and optimal evadable taxation
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY; TAX EVASION; WELFARE; ENFORCEMENT
AB In a simple model of evadable indirect taxation, some surprises emerge. Because of a 'market-thinning' effect of high prices, high taxes induce multiple equilibria (low-price black markets and high-price legal markets). Further, evadability introduces a bifurcation to optimal taxation: For less effective tax administrations, the optimal tax system follows a 'cash cow' pattern, with one sector bearing all of the tax; but for relatively effective administrations, the optimum follows a slightly modified Ramsey rule. This discontinuity results from the mathematics of evasion incentives, and may help explain tax reforms commonly seen over the course of economic development.

TI Two crises: Inflationary inertia and credibility
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides a comparative analysis of the Mexican currency crisis of 1994 and the Chilean crisis of 1982 to assess to what extent exchange-rate-based stabilisation programmes are successful in reducing -or even eliminating -inflationary inertia. The paper provides a brief overview of the Chilean and Mexican reform and stabilisation programmes. A theoretical model that emphasises the role of credibility is developed to analyse the effects of exchange-rate based stabilisation programmes on inflationary inertia. According to the model, less than credible stabilisations will not eliminate inertia and will generate major real exchange rate overvaluation. Detailed data are used to test the hypothesis.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The 1989 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act provides a natural experiment in which the effects of institutional change on economic relationships can be studied. The Act set price stability as the single objective of monetary policy and gave the Bank great independence. Reforms of this nature may lead to a greater short-run output-inflation tradeoff by altering optimal stabilisation policy and wage indexation. Allowing for environments where 'learning' about the new regime is assumed to be rapid as well as slow, we find that a large rise in the New Zealand tradeoff has occurred since implementation of the Act.

ID DRUG-USE; GENDER; BEHAVIOR; GAME; SEX; COOPERATION; FAIRNESS
AB Research in social sciences other than economics indicates substantial differences in behaviour between men and women. The general conclusion drawn from this work is that women will be more socially-orientated (selfless), and men more individually-orientated (selfish). This paper reports the results of a double-anonymous dictator experiment designed to permit the emergence of basic gender differences in economic behaviour. Our results are intended to provide a baseline for further research. We find that women, on average, donate twice as much as men to their anonymous partners when any factors that might confound cooperation are eliminated.

TI Conspiracies and secret discounts in laboratory markets
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

AB This paper uses laboratory methods to evaluate whether price-fixing conspiracies break down in the presence of opportunities to offer secret discounts. The primary treatment difference is whether or not buyer-specific discounts from the posted list price are permitted. In standard posted-offer markets, conspiring sellers almost uniformly find and maintain near-monopoly prices. Bur when the possibility of offering secret discounts is introduced, sellers find sustaining collusive agreements much more difficult, and transactions prices tend to fall toward competitive levels. Secret discounts yield competitive outcomes less consistently, however, when sellers are provided ex post information about sales quantities.

AB This paper attempts to provide microfoundations for the knowledge production function in an idea-based growth model. Production of new ideas is made a function of newly reconfigured old ideas in the spirit of the way an agricultural research station develops improved plant varieties by cross-pollinating existing plant varieties. The model shows how knowledge can build upon itself in a combinatoric feedback process that may have significant implications for economic growth. The paper's main theme is that the ultimate limits to growth lie not so much in our ability to generate new ideas as in our ability to process an abundance of potentially new ideas into usable form.

When managers can pursue other occupations while negotiating over the division of the gains from cooperation, the GHM results obtain. If taking the best alternative job terminates bargaining, outcomes are very different.

ID INTEGRATION; INVESTMENTS; CONTRACTS; FORM
AB Transactions take place in the firm rather than in the market because the firm offers power to agents who make specific investments. Past literature emphasizes the allocation of ownership as the primary mechanism by which the firm does this. Within the contractibility assumptions of this literature, we identify a potentially superior mechanism, the regulation of access to critical resources. Access can be better than ownership because (i) the power agents get from access is more contingent on their making the right investment and (ii) ownership has adverse effects on the incentive to specialize. The theory explains the importance of internal organization and third-party ownership.

AB We use data on health plan choices by employees of Harvard University to compare the benefits of insurance competition with the costs of adverse selection. Moving to a voucher-type system induced significant adverse selection, with a welfare loss of 2 to 4 percent of baseline spending. But increased competition reduced Harvard's premiums by 5 to 8 percent. The premium reductions came from insurer profits, so while Harvard was better off, the net effect for society was only the adverse selection loss. Adverse selection can be minimized by adjusting voucher amounts for individual risk. We discuss how such a system would work.

AB We develop a theory of the ownership of firms in an environment without secure property rights against state encroachment. "Private ownership" leads to excessive revenue hiding, and "state ownership" (i.e., national government ownership) fails to provide incentives for managers and local governments in a credible way. Because "local government ownership" integrates local government activities and business activities, local government may better serve the interests of the national government, and thus local government ownership may credibly limit state predation, increase local public goods provision, and reduce costly revenue hiding. We use our theory to interpret the relative success of local government-owned firms during China's transition to a market economy.

AB We model the electoral politics of redistribution when voters and parties care about inequality in addition to their private concerns for consumption and votes, respectively. Ideological concerns about income redistribution lead each party to adopt a general proportional income tax, adjusted to appeal to the ideological leanings of high "clout" groups, with disproportionately many "swing" voters, which the parties also ply with pork-barrel projects. Our results relate to "Director's Law," which says that redistributive politics favors middle classes at the expense of both rich and poor.

The investment by segments of highly diversified firms is less sensitive to their cash flow than the investment of comparable single-segment firms. The sensitivity of a segment's investment to the cash flow of other segments does not depend on whether its investment opportunities are better than those of the firm's other segments.

AB In 1990 Wisconsin began providing vouchers to a small number of low-income students to attend nonsectarian private schools. Controlling for individual fixed-effects, I compare the test scores of students selected to attend a participating private school with those of unsuccessful applicants and other students from the Milwaukee public schools. I find that students in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program had faster math score gains than, but similar reading score gains to, the comparison groups. The results appear robust to data imputations and sample attrition, although these deficiencies of the data should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.

   ANALYSIS
AB This paper places the debate over using consumption or income in studies of inequality growth in a formal intertemporal setting. It highlights the importance of permanent and transitory income uncertainty in the evaluation of growth in consumption inequality. We derive conditions under which the growth of variances and covariances of income and consumption can be used to separately identify the growth in the variance of permanent and transitory income shocks. Household data from Britain for the period 1968-1992 are used to show a strong growth in transitory inequality toward the end of this period, while younger cohorts are shown to face significantly higher levels of permanent inequality.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
AB Consumer theory suggests that expenditures on luxuries and durables should be more cyclical than expenditures on necessities and nondurables. Estimating luxuriousness and durability for 57 consumer goods, we confirm this prediction in U.S. data. We exploit this finding to test predictions of cyclical utilization and increasing returns models of business cycles. Both models predict more cyclical productivity for durable luxuries, a prediction borne out in the data. The utilization model predicts procyclical relative prices for durables and luxuries; the increasing returns model does not. Prices are more procyclical for durables and luxuries, discriminating in favor of cyclical utilization.

We examine the statistical model used to establish the empirical regularity and the intuitive behavioral interpretation often used to rationalize it. We show that the implicit economic model assumes myopia. The intuitive interpretive model is identified only by imposing arbitrary distributional assumptions onto the data. We produce an alternative choice-theoretic model with fewer parameters that rationalizes the same data and is not based on arbitrary distributional assumptions.

ID AGE; HOUSEHOLD; CHILDREN; EARNINGS; INCOME; MEN
AB Women are fecund for a shorter period of their lives than men. This paper investigates how differential fecundity interacts with marriage, labor, and financial markets to affect gender roles. The main findings of the paper are as follows: (i) Fecund women are relatively scarce. Men will behave differently than women in response to this scarcity. In the most fundamental way, demand and supply conditions in the marriage market affect gender roles. (ii) Differential fecundity does not have any market-invariant gender effect. Gender roles depend on the way in which marriage, labor, and financial markets interact. (iii) Gender differences in the labor market can occur without corresponding differences in labor market opportunities, productivities in child rearing, or social norms. (iv) With uncertainty in human capital accumulation and no insurance against this uncertainty, the model's predictions are consistent with observed gender roles.

ID MORAL HAZARD
AB An incentive contracting approach is used to characterize optimal contracts when insured individuals possess private information about their losses and are able to misrepresent permanently their loss magnitudes by engaging in the falsification of claims. We demonstrate that efficient agreements necessarily induce some falsification but that the extent of such claims inflation is mitigated partially by an indemnification schedule that overcompensates small losses while overpaying larger ones. The differential costs of generating insurance claims through falsification provide an avenue by which the heterogeneous insureds can credibly signal their underlying losses and are exploited in an optimal contract to implement loss-contingent insurance payments.

AB When both individual and aggregate consumer demand is uncertain and firms set prices before demand is known, price-taking firms may offer advance-purchase discounts. Consumers with relatively more certain demands and with relatively lower valuations have an incentive to buy in advance because the presence of other consumers with higher valuations and more uncertain aggregate demand increases the price they expect to pay in the spot market. Advance-purchase sales are made to low-valuation customers, as predicted by traditional models of second-degree price discrimination, without assuming that firms have market power.

AB This paper solves for equilibria of sequential bid (or English) auctions with affiliated values when jump bidding strategies may be employed to intimidate one's opponents. In these equilibria, jump bids serve as correlating devices which select asymmetric bidding functions to be played subsequently. Each possibility of jump bidding provides a Pareto improvement for the bidders from the symmetric equilibrium of a sealed bid, second-price auction. The expanded set of equilibria can approximate either first-or second-price outcomes and produce exactly the set of expected prices between those two bounds. These results contrast with standard conclusions that equate English and second-price auctions.

ID PERFECT COMPETITION; INCREASING RETURNS; EXTERNALITIES; EQUILIBRIUM;
   STABILITY; LOCATION; HISTORY
AB Most policy debates on regional policies implicitly assume that there is too much concentration. In our two-region model of migration, desirable concentration fails to occur under some conditions, and undesirable concentration occurs in others. In the latter case, even though the individuals collectively prefer to be distributed evenly across the two regions, they end up concentrating into one region in their pursuit of a better life. Hence, the freedom to move can be self-defeating. We characterize the conditions for such self-defeating concentration to occur. The coordination failures between the entry decision of service firms and the migration decision of individuals are caused by the incompleteness of markets due to the endogeneity of the range of services available, which deprive the agents of the opportunity to signal demand and supply for potential services. The argument does not rely on price distortions, the nonconvexities implied by increasing returns and nontradedness, congestion externalities, nor myopia in migration decisions.

AB This paper extends the bargaining and matching literature, such as Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1985), by considering a new matching process. We assume that a central information agency exists, such as real estate agencies in the housing market and employment agencies (or newspapers) in the labour market, which puts traders into direct contact with each other. With heterogeneity of trader preferences, equilibrium trade is characterized by existing traders on each side of the market trying to match with the flow of new traders on the other side (since existing traders have already sampled and rejected each other). Two procedures of trade co-exist, namely a strategic bilateral bargaining process and a competitive bidding process, depending on the number of potential matches a new trader obtains. We characterize the unique symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium to this stochastic trading game.

AB This paper develops the method of matching as an econometric evaluation estimator. A rigorous distribution theory for kernel-based matching is presented. The method of matching is extended to more general conditions than the ones assumed in the statistical literature on the topic. We focus on the method of propensity score matching and show that it is not necessarily better, in the sense of reducing the variance of the resulting estimator, to use the propensity score method even if propensity score is known. We extend the statistical literature on the propensity score by considering the case when it is estimated both parametrically and nonparametrically. We examine the benefits of separability and exclusion restrictions in improving the efficiency of the estimator. Our methods also apply to the econometric selection bias estimator.

Only the uninformed firm makes an offer and it can offer a menu of quality-wage contracts instead of single one. We show that for all discount factors, the unique sequential equilibrium outcome is separating without delay; the firm separates the types of worker with a menu of contracts in the first period. Our result shows that in multi-dimensional bargaining, the "Coase Conjecture" holds in the sense that the game ends in the first period. But it fails in the sense that the uninformed party can preserve the entire bargaining power.

ID ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; EXPECTATIONS
AB Speculators buy an asset hoping to sell it later to investors with higher private valuations. If agents are uncertain about the distribution of private valuations and about the beliefs of others about this distribution, a beauty contest with an infinite hierarchy of beliefs arises. Under Harsanyi's assumption of a common prior the infinite beliefs hierarchy is readily solved using Bayes' law. This paper shows that common knowledge of the "beliefs formation rule," mapping the private valuation of each agent into his first-order belief, also simplifies the beliefs hierarchy while allowing for disagreement among agents. We analyse the resulting speculation in a stylized asset market. Several statistics, computed only from readily observable quote, return and volume data, are evaluated in terms of their power to discriminate between genuine disagreement and the Harsanyian case. Only statistics that relate volume and volatility, or volume and changes in best offers, have the necessary discriminatory power.

Conditions are given for the existence of equilibrium, and it is shown how APT and CAPM can be interpreted in the framework of the paper. If sufficiently many call options on the market portfolio are traded, then the space spanned by these options can be used as the factor subspace.

AB A theoretical and computational model with tax-financed tuition-free public schools and competitive, tuition-financed private schools is developed. Students differ by ability and income. Achievement depends on own ability and on peers abilities. Equilibrium has a strict hierarchy of school qualities and two-dimensional student sorting with stratification by ability and income. In private schools, high-ability, low-income students receive tuition discounts, while low-ability, high-income students pay tuition premia. Tuition vouchers increase the relative size of the private sector and the extent of student sorting, and benefit high-ability students relative to low-ability students.

ID RULES
AB People differ in how they respond to their environment. Some individuals treat each situation as unique and tailor their behavior accordingly while others respond in the same manner regardless of the situation. My objective is to explore how social systems select from such a heterogeneous population. A class of simple hierarchical systems is considered which encompasses some features of corporations and electoral systems: A selection process operates on this population which results in successful agents going on to compete against equally successful agents for further advancement. I characterize the population dynamics and the type of agent that ultimately dominates.

AB How can boards be chosen through a process partially controlled by the CEO, yet, in many instances, still be effective monitors of him? We offer an answer based on a model in which board effectiveness is a function of its independence. This, in turn, is a function of negotiations (implicit or explicit) between existing directors and the CEO over who will fill vacancies on the board. The CEO's bargaining power over the board-selection process comes from his perceived ability relative to potential successors. Many empirical findings about board structure and performance arise as equilibrium phenomena of this model.

AB This paper presents a general equilibrium model of renewable resource and population dynamics related to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, with man as the predator and the resource base as the prey. We apply the model to the rise and fall of Easter Island, showing that plausible parameter values generate a 'feast and famine" pattern of cyclical adjustment in population and resource stocks. Near-monotonic adjustment arises for higher values of a resource regeneration parameter, as might apply elsewhere in Polynesia. We also describe other civilizations that might have declined because of population overshooting and endogenous resource degradation.

AB This paper studies the efficiency of policy choice in representative democracies. It extends the citizen-candidate model of democratic policy-making to a dynamic environment. Equilibrium policy choices are shown to be efficient in the sense that in each period conditional on future policies being selected through the democratic process, there exists no alternative current policy choices which can raise the expected utilities of all citizens. However, policies that would be declared efficient by standard economic criteria are not necessarily adopted in political equilibrium. The paper argues that these divergencies are legitimately viewed as "political failures."

AB We study a population of agents, each of whom can be an Altruist or an Egoist. Altruism is a strictly dominated strategy. Agents choose their actions by imitating others who earn high payoffs. Interactions between agents are local, so that each agent affects (and is affected by) only his neighbors. Altruists can survive in such a world if they are grouped together, so that the benefits of altruism are enjoyed primarily by other Altruists, who then earn relatively high payoffs and are imitated. Altruists continue to survive in the presence of mutations that continually introduce Egoists into the population.

ID INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; POLICY; ELECTIONS; VOTERS; CYCLES
AB Substantial policy changes (like market-oriented reforms by populist parties and steps towards pence by "hawks") are sometimes implemented by "unlikely" parties. To account for such episodes this paper develops a framework in which incumbent politicians have better information about the state of the world than voters. The incumbent is unable to credibly transmit all this information since voters are also imperfectly informed about his ideology. This paper identifies conditions under which an incumbent party's electoral prospects increase the more atypical the policy it proposes. Popular support for a policy, or its "credibility," depends on the policy maker-policy pair.

AB model is proposed to explain the results of recent experiments in which subjects repeatedly played a coordination game, with the right to play auctioned each period in a larger group. Subjects bid the market-clearing price to a level recoverable only in the efficient equilibrium and then converged to that equilibrium, although subjects playing the game without auctions converged to inefficient equilibria. The efficiency-enhancing effect of auctions is reminiscent of forward induction, but is not explained by equilibrium refinements. The model explains it by showing how strategic uncertainty interacts with history-dependent learning dynamics to determine equilibrium selection.

AB This paper studies tax reforms in a dynamic model of a global economy calibrated to current U.S. and European tax policies. World capital markers add consumption-smoothing and income-redistribution effects that alter closed-economy predictions. In the absence of tares on foreign interest, welfare gains of eliminating U.S. income taxes are enlarged by up to 34 percent, at the expense of European losses caused by transitional declines in consumption and leisure, and a permanent capital outflow. In contrast, if foreign interest is taxed, the same tax reform reduces U.S. welfare 0.7 percent and increases European welfare 1.8 percent.

AB The volunteer armed forces play a major role in the American youth labor market, but little is known about the effects of voluntary military service on earnings. The effects of military service are difficult to measure because veterans are both self-selected and screened by the military. This study uses two strategies to reduce selection bias in estimates of the effects of military service on the earnings of veterans. Both approaches involve the analysis of a special match of Social Security earning records to administrative data on applicants to the armed forces. The first strategy compares applicants who enlisted with applicants who did not enlist, while controlling for most of the characteristics used by the military to select soldiers from the applicant pool. This is implemented using matching methods and regression. The second strategy uses instrumental variables that were generated by an error in the scoring of the exams that screen military applicants. Estimates from bath strategies are interpreted using models with heterogeneous potential outcomes. The empirical results suggest that soldiers who served in the early 1980s were paid considerably more than comparable civilians while in the military, and that military service is associated with higher employment rates for veterans after service. In spite of this employment gain, however, military service led to only a modest long-run increase in the civilian earnings of nonwhite veterans while actually reducing the civilian earnings of white veterans.

AB Many non/semi-parametric time series estimates may be regarded as different forms of sieve extremum estimates. For stationary beta-mixing observations, we obtain convergence rates of sieve extremum estimates and root-n asymptotic normality of "plug-in" sieve extremum estimates of smooth functionals. As applications to time series models, we give convergence rates for nonparametric ARX(p, q) regression via neural networks, splines, and wavelets; root-n asymptotic normality for partial linear additive AR(p) models, and monotone transformation AR(1) models.

   estimation of average treatment effects
SO ECONOMETRICA

DT Article
DE treatment effect; propensity score; semiparametric efficiency bound
AB In this paper, the role of the propensity score in the efficient estimation of average treatment effects is examined. Under the assumption that the treatment is ignorable given some observed characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is ancillary for estimation of the average treatment effects. The propensity score is not ancillary for estimation of average treatment effects on the treated. It is suggested that the marginal value of the propensity score lies entirely in the "dimension reduction." Efficient semiparametric estimators of average treatment effects and average treatment effects on the treated are shown to take the form of relevant sample averages of the data completed by the nonparametric imputation method. It is shown that the projection on the propensity score is not necessary for efficient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects on the treated even if the propensity score is known. An application to the experimental data reveals that conditioning on the propensity score may even result in a loss of efficiency.

AB One-step efficient GMM estimation has been developed in the recent papers of Back and Brown (1990), Imbens (1993), and Qin and Lawless (1994). These papers emphasized methods that correspond to using Owen's (1988) method of empirical likelihood to reweight the data so that the reweighted sample obeys all the moment restrictions at the parameter estimates. In this paper we consider an alternative KLIC motivated weighting and show how it and similar discrete reweightings define a class of unconstrained optimization problems which includes GMM as a special case. Such KLIC-motivated reweightings introduce M auxiliary "tilting" parameters, where M is the number of moments; parameter and overidentification hypotheses can be recast in terms of these tilting parameters. Such tests are often startlingly more effective than their conventional counterparts. These differences are not completely explained by differences in the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of the test statistics.

AB Asymptotic normality of the posterior is a well understood result for dynamic as well as nondynamic models based on sets of abstract conditions whose actual applicability is hardly known especially for the case of nonstationarity. In this paper we provide a set of conditions by which we can relatively easily prove the asymptotic posterior normality under quite general situations of possible nonstationarity. This result reinforces and generalizes the point of Sims and Uhlig (1991) that inference based on the likelihood principle, explained by Berger and Wolpert (1988), will be unchanged regardless of whether the data are generated by a stationary process or by a unit root process. On the other hand, our conditions allow us to generalize the Bayesian information criterion known as the Schwarz criterion to the case of possible nonstationarity. In addition, we have shown that consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator, not the asymptotic normality of the estimator, with some minor additional assumptions is sufficient for asymptotic posterior normality.

AB This paper analyzes how self-interested subjects, as opposed to altruistic investigators, evaluate treatments in social experiments. We argue that the attrition behavior of subjects reveals their evaluation of treatments, and we discuss the usefulness of using such data in performing subject-based evaluation. We examine the possible causes of disagreements between investigators and subjects in their evaluation of treatments, and empirically assess the extent to which they disagree. Given that disagreements between subject evaluation and evaluation done by investigators could be due to sampling error, this paper provides an empirical framework for estimating the systematic level of disagreement in the presence of such errors. We illustrate this framework by estimating the extent of disagreement in clinical trials, and we find substantial evidence of over-approval by investigators in about one-third of the trials analyzed.

The first is to demonstrate the dual Liapounov stability of a von Neumann facet without the restrictive assumptions on the structure of underlying-technologies that are commonly adopted in the optimal growth literature. The second result is to demonstrate that a temporary change in fiscal policy has almost no effect on present and future consumption. While such inefficacy of temporary fiscal policy has been discussed in the context of the permanent income hypothesis, in this study, it is proved in the dynamic general equilibrium framework under a set of basic assumptions of general equilibrium theory.

The standard neutrality result for fully funded pension schemes does not hold in this framework.

AB Lucas has recently suggested that the 'shoe-leather' costs of inflation may amount to as much as 1% of GNP in the United States when moving to the Friedman optimum. We assess his thesis using empirical evidence for the United Kingdom over the period 1870-1994. We find support for Lucas' proposition - that interest rates should be specified in logs - as a description of money demand dynamics, but not as a steady-state characterisation. Although Lucas' estimates can be corroborated, a semilog interest rate specification implies smaller, though still tangible, welfare gain estimates: for example, 0.22% of GNP in perpetuity when moving from 6% to 2% nominal interest rates.

Nine indexes of trade policy are used to investigate whether the evidence supports the view that total factor productivity growth is faster in more open economies. The results are robust to the use of openness indicator, estimation technique, time period and functional form, and suggest that more open countries experienced faster productivity growth. Although the use of instrumental variables help dealing with endogeneity, issues related to causality remain somewhat open, and require time series analyses to be adequately addressed.

The key feature characterising the analysis is that the public good is treated as a durable capital good, subject to congestion. We show how in the presence of congestion the effect of government investment on private capital formation involves a tradeoff between the degree of substitution between private and public capital in production and the degree of congestion. Both lump-sum and distortionary tax financing are considered, with this tradeoff being tightened in the latter case.

AB UK commentators have noted that the UK housing market may hinder labour market flexibility. The present paper uses UK household longitudinal data (BHPS) for the early 1990s, and estimates single and competing risk discrete time duration models of residence duration to investigate the impact of negative housing equity on residential moves. Strong evidence for an adverse impact on mobility is found, along with results to suggest that the home-owners do not move in response to changing labour market conditions. Negative equity in the early 1990s therefore exacerbated housing market related rigidities in the job matching process.

TI How much income mobility is there in Britain?
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Using the first four waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1991-4) and a variety of methods, we show that there is much mobility in household net income from one year to the next in Britain. However most income changes from one year to the next are not very large, and when incomes are longitudinally averaged so that transitory variations are smoothed out, substantial 'permanent' income differences are revealed. There is some evidence of greater mobility for those in the tails of the income distribution relative to the middle, and for elderly persons compared to nonelderly persons.

AB We develop a partial equilibrium model of foreign direct investment (FDI) in which identical foreign firms locate themselves in a host country to compete in an oligopolistic market for a non-tradeable commodity. The host country, assumed to be small in the market for FDI, makes use of two instruments, viz., a profit tax and a local content requirement, to compete for FDI in the international market. We assume the existence of unemployment in the host country. The structure of optimal instruments and their relationship to the number, and the relative efficiency levels, of the domestic firms, are established.

AB Intervention analysis is proposed as a method for estimating the effects of anti-dumping actions in the presence of a domestic cartel. Data requirements and modelling effort compare favourably with traditional structural model approaches. The method is applied to an antidumping action brought to the European Commission and in which the European producers of the product were fined after an anti-cartel action by the Commission covering an overlapping period. Intervention analysis is applied to distinguish the effects of the anti-dumping action from those of changes in cartel behaviour.

AB This paper describes an experiment where respondents were asked to tackle two decision tasks which were very similar in structure, but which differed in that one problem involved direct money payoffs while the other involved payoffs in the form of probabilities of winning a given sum of money. According to most decision models, most risk averse individuals might be expected to behave quite differently under the two conditions. But the behaviour actually observed does not accord with this expectation. The paper discusses possible reasons for this and the potential implications of such findings.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

AB Producing high technology output and supplying sophisticated services often involves costly investment in industry-specific skills. But the threat of poaching means that it is the individual 'stakeholder', not the firm, who must bear the cost. We investigate various mechanisms for funding human capital investment in an industry equilibrium framework where capital market imperfections would (in the absence of intervention) result in underinvestment. The main result is that government provision of loan guarantees (conditional on no-bankruptcy) leads to wage hikes which raises profits in a socially inefficient manner: income contingent loans and levy subsidy schemes, meanwhile, can result in a socially efficient outcome.

AB This paper investigates labour market responses to trade liberalisation in an industrialising country. Short and long run responses of employment and wages are examined using a specific factor trade model, which underpins the empirical work. Employment and wage equations are estimated using dynamic panel techniques for importable and exportable sectors in Mauritius and for a period covering both the pre-and post-liberalisation regimes. The empirical testing finds some support for the theoretical predictions of differential responses between sectors. Increases in female participation, however, appear to have dampened the adjustment burdens of liberalisation on importables.

AB This paper examines some problems which arise when monetary policy is delegated to an independent central bank and where the central bank's preferences are unknown. Two key conclusions emerge from the paper. First, even with optimal targets or contracts, central bank independence may not always be desirable because central banks may have distorted preferences relative to society. Second, if the delegation solution is preferable, and the independent central bank responds to information about supply shocks, the central bank may be made more accountable by allowing it to set its own inflation targets, i.e. by making it goal-independent.

TI Private and public supply of liquidity
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
ID FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; DEPOSIT INSURANCE; BANK RUNS; DEBT; RISK
AB This paper addresses a basic, yet unresolved, question: Do claims on private assets provide sufficient liquidity for an efficient functioning of the productive sector? Or does the state have a role in creating liquidity and regulating it either through adjustments in the stock of government securities or by other means? In our model, firms can meet future liquidity needs in three ways: by issuing new claims, by obtaining a credit line from a financial intermediary, and by holding claims on other firms. When there is no aggregate uncertainty, we show that these instruments are sufficient for implementing the socially optimal (second-best) contract between investors and firms. However, the implementation may require an intermediary to coordinate the use of scarce liquidity, in which case contracts with the intermediary impose both a maximum leverage ratio and a liquidity constraint on firms. When there is only aggregate uncertainty, the private sector cannot satisfy its own liquidity needs. The government can improve welfare by issuing bonds that commit future consumer income. Government bonds command a liquidity premium over private claims. The government should manage debt so that liquidity is loosened (the value of bonds is high) when the aggregate liquidity shock is high and is tightened when the liquidity shock is low. The paper thus suggests a rationale both for government-supplied liquidity and for its active management.

ID RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; QUALITY LADDERS;
   ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MODEL
AB An increase in the size (scale) of an economy increases the total quantity of rents that can be captured by successful innovators, which, in equilibrium, should lead to a rise in innovative activity. Conventional wisdom and the theoretical predictions of models of endogenous innovation suggest that this increased research effort should lead to more rapid growth. As noted by Charles Jones, this prediction is at odds with the postwar experience of the OECD, where the growth of the market has indeed led to an increased R & D effort that, however, has been translated into stagnant or declining growth rates. Drawing on the remarkable insights of the museum curator Seabury C. Gilfillan, this paper modifies models of endogenous innovation to allow for the possibility that a rise in the profitability of innovative activity could lead to an increased variety of differentiated solutions to similar problems. An increased variety of technologies (e.g., an increase in the number and types of contraceptives) will increase the level of utility of the average consumer. If, however, continued improvement of this increased variety of technologies requires increased research input, a rise in the scale of the market could raise the equilibrium quantity of R & D without increasing the economy's growth rate.

ID COMMON AGENCY
AB In this paper, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding the phenomenon of exclusive dealing, and we explore the motivations for and effects of its use. For a broad class of models, we characterize the outcome of a contracting game in which manufacturers may employ exclusive dealing provisions in their contracts. We then apply this characterization to a sequence of specialized settings. We demonstrate that exclusionary contractual provisions may be irrelevant, anticompetitive, or efficiency-enhancing, depending on the setting. More specifically, we exhibit the potential for anticompetitive effects in noncoincident markets (i.e., markets other than the ones in which exclusive dealing is practiced), and we explore the potential for the enhancement of efficiency in a setting in which common representation gives rise to incentive conflicts. In each instance, we describe the manner in which equilibrium outcomes would be altered by a ban on exclusive dealing. We demonstrate that a ban may have surprisingly subtle and unintended effects.

The model is estimated jointly with equations for mode, expenditure on and hours of care, and the mother's labor supply The results show that a lower price of child care in a particular mode leads to substitution toward that mode and an increase in the use of paid child care. A decrease in the price of care causes an increase in hours of care demanded and a decrease in the demand for quality-related attributes. Income effects on demand for quality are small.

The model assumes that these graduates act according to the optimal solution of a dynamic optimization problem in which they sequentially choose among five employment sectors. The employment sectors are differentiated by pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns, promotion and dismissal probabilities, and the extent of transferability of human capital. The estimation of the model reveals a self-selection mechanism, based on unobserved heterogeneity in abilities and expected future returns, which plays a critical role in reproducing the sector-specific nonmonotonic separation hazards observed in the data. The underlying self-selection mechanism also has implications for policy interventions in the market for lawyers, such as loan forgiveness programs.

AB Posttakeover moral hazard by the acquirer and free-riding by the target shareholders lead the former to acquire as few shares as necessary to gain control. As moral hazard is most severe under such low ownership concentration, inefficiencies arise in successful takeovers. Moreover, share supply is shown to be upward-sloping. Rules promoting ownership concentration limit both agency costs and the occurrence of takeovers. Furthermore, higher takeover premia induced by competition translate into higher ownership concentration and are thus beneficial. Finally, one share-one vote and simple majority are generally not optimal, and socially optimal rules need not emerge through private contracting.

AB Studies of horse race betting have empirically established a long shot anomaly; that is, low-probability, high-variance bets (long shots) provide low mean returns and high-probability, low-variance bets provide relatively high mean returns. Because betters willingly accept low-return, high-variance bets, researchers conclude that betters are risk lovers. In this study, we show that the data are at least as consistent with risk aversion as they are with risk loving when one explicitly considers the skewness of bet returns. Because the variance and skewness of bet returns are highly correlated, betters may appear to prefer variance when it is skewness that they crave.

AB Lojack is a hidden radio-transmitter device used for retrieving stolen vehicles. Because there is no external indication that Lojack has been installed, it does not directly affect the likelihood that a protected car will be stolen. There may, however, be positive externalities due to general deterrence. We find that the availability of Lojack is associated with a sharp fall in auto theft. Rates of other crime do not change appreciably. At least historically, the marginal social benefit of an additional unit of Lojack has been fifteen times greater than the marginal social cost in high crime areas. Those who install Lojack, however, obtain less than 10 percent of the total social benefits, leading to underprovision by the market.

ID ADVERSE SELECTION; TURNOVER
AB This paper offers a theory of training whereby workers do not pay for the general training they receive. The superior information of the current employer regarding its employees' abilities relative to other firms creates ex post monopsony power, and encourages this employer to provide and pay for training, even if these skills are general. The model can lead to multiple equlibria. In one equilibrium quits are endogenously high, and as a result employers have limited monopsony power and provide little training, while in another equilibrium quits are low and training is high. Using microdata on German apprentices, we show that the predictions of our model receive some support from the data.

TI Investment tax incentives, prices, and the supply of capital goods
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MARKET
AB Using data on the prices of capital goods, this paper shows that much of the benefit of investment tax incentives does not go to Investing firms but rather to capital suppliers through higher prices. A 10 percent investment tax credit increases equipment prices 3.5-7.0 percent. This lasts several years and is largest for assets with large order backlogs or low import competition. Capital goods workers' wages rise, too. Instrumental variables estimates of the short-run supply elasticity are around 1 and can explain the traditionally small estimates of investment demand elasticities. In absolute value, the demand elasticity implied here exceeds 1.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE PAY; INDUSTRY; TOP
AB Salesperson and executive compensation contracts typically specify a nonlinear relationship between firm revenues and pay. These agents therefore have incentive to manipulate prices, influence the timing of customer purchases, and vary effort over their firms' fiscal years. This paper empirically establishes results consistent with agents' focusing on performance over the fiscal year. Most notably, in addition to varying with the calendar business cycle, manufacturing firms' sales are higher at the end of the fiscal year, and lower at the beginning, than they are in the middle. Further evidence is found in fiscal-year price movements and patterns in the industry variation of fiscal-year effects.

TI The choice of stock ownership structure: Agency costs, monitoring and
   the decision to go public
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LARGE SHAREHOLDER
AB From the viewpoint of a company's controlling shareholder, the optimal ownership structure generally involves some measure of dispersion, to avoid excessive monitoring by other shareholders. The optimal dispersion cf share ownership can be achieved by going public, but this choice also entails some costs (the cost of listing and the loss of control over the shareholder register). If the controlling shareholder sells shares privately instead, he avoids the costs of going public but must tolerate large external shareholders who may monitor him too closely. Thus, the owner faces a trade-off between the cost of providing a liquid market and overmonitoring. The incentive to go public is stronger, the larger the amount of external funding required. The listing decision is also affected by the strictness of disclosure rules for public relative to private firms, and the legal limits on bribes aimed at dissuading monitoring by shareholders.

AB Preferential trading arrangements are analyzed from the viewpoint of the "new political economy" that views trade policy as being determined by lobbying of concentrated interest groups. Two conclusions are reached: first, that trade-diverting preferential arrangements are more likely to be supported politically; and second, that such preferential arrangements could critically change domestic incentives so multilateral liberalization that is initially politically feasible could be rendered infeasible by a preferential arrangement. The larger the trade diversion resulting from the preferential arrangement, the more likely this will be the case.

We estimate an average return to schooling of 9 percent for identical twins, but estimated returns appear to be slightly higher for less able individuals. Simple cross-section estimates are marginally upward biased. These empirical results imply that abler individuals attain more schooling because they face lower marginal costs of school:mg, not because of higher marginal benefits.

AB This study investigates the economic consequences of rights to paid parental leave in nine European countries over the 1969 through 1993 period. Since women use virtually all parental leave in most nations, men constitute a reasonable comparison group, and most of the analysis examines how changes in paid leave affect the gap between female and male labor market outcomes. The employment-to-populations ratios of women in their prime childbearing years are also compared with those of corresponding aged men and older females. Parental leave is associated with increases in women's employment, but with reductions in their relative wages at extended durations.

DT Article
AB This paper comments on recent developments in the literature on the econometric analysis of international growth and convergence. It notes that panel estimates of the neoclassical model, accommodating level effects for individual countries through heterogeneous intercepts, deal with some of the econometric difficulties arising in some of the earlier cross-sectional studies. But it notes that, in dynamic panels, heterogeneity in growth effects and in speeds of convergence renders this estimator inconsistent also. The pervasiveness of such heterogeneity is demonstrated in three samples of countries, and the effects of (incorrectly) imposing homogeneity on estimated parameters are illustrated and discussed.

AB This research explores the medical care consumption and absenteeism decisions of employed individuals with acute illnesses in an effort to better understand behavior that may contribute to the upward spiraling costs of health care. The theoretical framework models the decisions to visit a doctor and/or to miss work during an episode of acute illness as the sequential choices of individuals solving a discrete choice stochastic dynamic programming problem. Using data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), I estimate the structural parameters of an individual's optimization problem. Structural estimation, as opposed to conventional reduced form estimation methods that are prevalent in the health care literature, allows for the introduction and evaluation of the impact of new public policy initiatives relating to health care. The estimates allow for predictions of the change in physician services use and illness-related absenteeism that arise with improvements in access to health care through more complete health insurance and sick leave coverage.

ID CHANGE-POINT; REGRESSION; PARAMETER; LAWS
AB This paper considers issues related to multiple structural changes, occurring at unknown dates, in the linear regression model estimated by least squares. The main aspects are the properties of the estimators, including the estimates of the break dates, and the construction of tests that allow inference to be made about the presence of structural change and the number of breaks. We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l+1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.

ID MONTE-CARLO TESTS; LINEAR REGRESSIONS; SERIAL-CORRELATION
AB Methods are proposed to build exact tests and confidence sets in the linear first-order autoregressive distributed lag model with i.i.d. disturbances. For general linear hypotheses on the regression coefficients, inference procedures are obtained which have known level. The tests proposed are either similar (i.e., they have constant rejection probability for all data generating processes consistent with the null hypothesis) or use bounds which are free of nuisance parameters. Correspondingly the confidence sets are either similar with known size (i.e., they have constant coverage probability) or conservative. We also develop exact tests and confidence sets for various nonlinear transformations of model parameters, such as long-run multipliers and mean lags. The practical usefulness of these exact methods, which are also asymptotically valid under weak regularity conditions, is illustrated by some power comparisons and with applications to a dynamic trend model of money velocity and a model of money demand.

ID UNIT-ROOT; TIME-SERIES; HETEROSKEDASTICITY; INFERENCE; SELECTION; MODELS
AB In this paper test statistics are proposed that can be used to test hypotheses about the parameters of the deterministic trend function of a univariate time series. The tests are valid in the presence of general forms of serial correlation in the errors and can be used without having to estimate the serial correlation parameters either parametrically or nonparametrically. The tests are valid for I(0) and I(1) errors. Trend functions that are permitted include general linear polynomial trend functions that may have breaks at either known or unknown locations. Asymptotic distributions are derived, and consistency of the tests is established. The general results are applied to a model with a simple linear trend. A local asymptotic analysis is used to compute asymptotic size and power of the tests for this example. Size is well controlled and is relatively unaffected by the variance of the initial condition. Asymptotic power curves are computed for the simple linear trend model and are compared to existing tests. It is shown that the new tests have nontrivial asymptotic power. A simulation study shows that the asymptotic approximations are adequate for sample sizes typically used in economics. The tests are used to construct confidence intervals for average GNP growth rates for eight industrialized countries using post-war data.

AB Quality of life depends on various physical and social conditions, such as the epidemiological environment in which a person lives. The availability of health care and the nature of medical insurance-public as well as private-are among the important influences on life and death. So are other social services, including basic education and the orderliness of urban living, and the access to modern medical knowledge in rural communities. The statistics on mortality draw our attention to all these policy issues. Mortality information can throw light also on the nature of social inequalities, including gender bias and racial disparities.

ID GROWTH
AB This paper explores the propositions that, income inequality is relatively stable within countries; and that it varies significantly among countries. A new and expanded data set provides broad support for both propositions. Drawing on a political economy and capital market imperfection arguments to explain the intertemporal and international variation in inequality, the empirical analysis shows that the predicted variables associated with the first argument (a measure of civil liberties and the initial level of secondary schooling) and the second argument (a measure of financial depth and the initial distribution of land) are indeed important determinants of inequality.

ID GROWTH
AB We show that greater income equality implies higher human capital accumulation and economic performance in an overlapping-generations model with heterogeneity in income and talent. Given liquidity constraints and declining marginal utility, individuals with a given level of talent receive education if their initial income is higher than a threshold level and the threshold is lower for more talented individuals. Assuming the more talented create more human capital when educated, greater initial income equality for one generation then imply not only higher aggregate human capital accumulated by that generation but an improvement in all subseqent generations Initial income distributions.

ID MODEL
AB After a long dormant period, Lower Sixth Avenue in New York has undergone a rapid revitalisation. We show that a simple search theoretic model with information spillovers can explain both the period of underuse and the rapid turnaround. The model reduces to a simple equation, which allows us to do comparative statics on the duration of vacancies. We show how the solution reacts to changes in market structure and changes in search technology. The model is suggestive of difficulties that may occur in many markets in which there are changes over time in the optimal use of resources.

ID RATIONAL ADDICTION; CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; DYNAMICS
AB We present a theory of addictive behaviour which can account for addicts' apparent disregard for the future consequences of their current actions. The discounting of future utility is increasing in past consumption, indicating increasingly myopic behaviour as consumption increases. The intertemporal complementarity generated by the endogenous discounting produces multiple steady states which can account for the simultaneous existence of myopic addicts and non-myopic non-addicts within a time consistent expected utility framework. The theory also accounts for the probabilistic incidence of addiction and successful rehabilitation and the possibility of recurrence.

ID STABILIZATION; COUNTRIES; DYNAMICS; COSTS; MONEY
AB Exchange rate-based stabilisations in chronic-inflation countries have often been characterised by an initial consumption boom (which is most evident in the behaviour of durable goods) followed by a later contraction. This paper provides an explanation for such a boom-recession cycle based on the timing of purchases of durable goods. The initial fall in inflation results in a wealth effect which induces many consumers to bring forward their purchases of durable goods, thus generating an aggregate consumption boom. Since most consumers replenish their stock of durable goods at the beginning of the programme, a rater slowdown follows.

AB We develop a methodology for analyzing the revenue and efficiency performance of auctions when buyers have private information about their willingness to pay and ability to pay. We then apply the framework to scenarios involving standard auction mechanisms. In the simplest case, where bidders face absolute spending limits, first-price auctions yield higher expected revenue and social surplus than second-price auctions. The revenue dominance of first-price auctions over second-price auctions carries over to the case where bidders have access to credit. These rankings are explained by differences in the extent to which financial constraints bind in different auction formats.

The formal results provide probability bounds for convergence which can be used to describe the local stability under learning of rational expectations equilibria in stochastic models. Economic examples include local stability in a multivariate linear model with multiple equilibria and global convergence in a model with a unique equilibrium.

It provides a set of conditions for making statistical inferences about agents' expectations of their correlated future choices, from a short panel. Under the assumption that observed allocations are Pareto optimal, a dynamic model of female labour supply and participation is estimated, in which experience on the job raises future wages, and time spent off the job in the past directly affects current utility (or, indirectly through productivity in the non-market sector).

ID DYNAMIC-MODELS; UNITED-STATES; INFLATION; CHOICE; ESTIMATOR; MARKET
AB In many theoretical models, it is assumed that there are costs associated with adjusting prices. In this paper, the existence, type, and magnitude of such costs are investigated empirically. A discrete-choice dynamic-programming model that nests fixed and variable costs is developed, and econometric estimates of the adjustment-cost function are obtained. The data used to implement the model consist of weekly retail prices and sales of three brands of saltine crackers sold by four chains of grocery stores in a small U.S. town. The study has several distinguishing characteristics. First, the data are highly disaggregate (at the level of brand and store). Second, variables are sampled at weekly intervals. Third, the model nests fixed-and variable-adjustment costs and can therefore determine their relative importance. Finally, the discrete-choice model is both structural and dynamic.

The method deals with the case in which the measurement errors are serially correlated, generalizing previous contributions. A class of efficient estimators are derived for the latent data. Consistent estimators for the weight matrices applied to the observed information based on a linear regression procedure are obtained together with confidence interval estimators for these weight matrices. Approximate confidence intervals are suggested for the latent data themselves together with specification tests for the assumptions underlying the procedure. An application of the proposed method is made to U.K. Gross Domestic Product in constant prices for 1958Q1-1989Q4.

AB This paper analyses the sustainability of inter-generational transfers in Samuelson's consumption-loan model when agents are imperfectly informed about past events. We find that with mild informational constraints, transfers cannot be supported by pure-strategy equilibria. Mixed strategies allow transfers to be sustained even if agents have little information, so that a version of the Folk theorem holds. However, these equilibria are not robust. If each agent's utility function is subjected to a small random perturbation as in Harsanyi (1973), these mixed strategy equilibria unravel, and only the zero-transfer allocation survives as the unique rationalizable outcome. This result is an example of mixed strategy equilibrium of an extensive form game which cannot be purified.

TI Innovation and bureaucracy under soft and hard budget constraints
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID HIERARCHIES; POLYARCHIES; CREDIT; MODEL
AB Because of the inherent uncertainty, promotion of innovation critically depends on screening mechanisms to select projects. This paper studies the relationship between bureaucracy and financial constraints as two such mechanisms. The lack of commitment to hard financial constraints interferes with its ex post screening capability; ex ante bureaucratic screening is optimally chosen as a substitute. However, bureaucracy makes mistakes by rejecting promising projects and delays innovation, and the efficiency loss due to soft financial constraints increases as prior knowledge becomes worse and as research stage investment requirements become lower. In a centralized economy, bureaucracy may reduce the number of parallel projects, particularly for projects with higher uncertainties and less research stage requirements. This theory fits much of the evidence and in particular it explains why the computer industry, but not the nuclear or aerospace industries, has fared so poorly in centralized economies.

TI A general characterization of optimal income tax enforcement
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICIES; TRADEOFF; EVASION; DESIGN
AB This paper develops a general approach to characterizing optimal income tax and enforcement schemes. Our analysis clarifies the nature of the interplay between tax rates, audit probabilities and penalties for misreporting. In particular, it is shown that for a variety of objective functions for the principal the optimal tax schedule is in general concave (at least weakly) and monotonic; the marginal tax rates determine the audit probabilities; and less harsh penalties lead to higher enforcement costs. Our results imply that there exists a tradeoff between equity and efficiency considerations in the enforcement context which is similar to that in the moral hazard context for tax policy.

TI Exchange economies and loss exposure: Experiments exploring prospect
   theory and competitive equilibria in market environments
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CHOICE
AB Exchange economies were created in which individuals faced losses. If people are risk seeking in the losses, as predicted by prospect theory, then due to the nonconvexity, the competitive equilibria are all on the boundaries of the Edgeworth Box. The experimental results are that risk-seeking behavior is observed in many people and appears in markets as predicted. In addition, market behavior is consistent with answers to hypothetical questionnaires. Contrary to prospect theory, risk seeking seems to diminish with experience; preferences in the market setting are not labile; and risk-seeking preferences are not simply a result of framing effects.

These random assignments are changed round to round, enabling the measurement of individual player contribution rates as a function of that player's investment cost. We directly test these response functions for the presence of warm-glow and/or altruism effects. We find significant evidence for heterogeneous warm-glow effects that are, on average, low in magnitude. We statistically reject the presence of an altruism effect.

ID BAYES-RULE; MARKETS; MODELS
AB When a series of individuals with private information announce public predictions, initial conformity can create an "information cascade" in which later predictions match the early announcements. This paper reports an experiment in which private signals are draws from an unobserved urn. Subjects make predictions in sequence and are paid if they correctly guess which of two urns was used for the draws. If initial decisions coincide, then it is rational for subsequent decision makers to follow the established pattern, regardless of their private information. Rational cascades formed in most periods in which such an imbalance occurred.

Despite temporary confusion about bank asset quality on the part of depositors during the panic, which was associated with widespread depositor runs and bank stock price declines, the panic did not produce significant social costs in terms of failures among solvent banks.

AB This paper shows that in several U.S. manufacturing industries, the seasonal variability of production and inventories varies with the state of the business cycle. We present a simple model which implies that if firms reduce the seasonal variability of their production as the economy strengthens, and they either hold constant or increase the stock of inventories they bring into the high-production seasons of the year, then they must be facing upward-sloping and convex marginal cost curves. We conclude that firms in a number of industries face upward-sloping and convex marginal-production-cost curves.

AB This paper develops a computable general equilibrium model in which endogenous agency costs can potentially alter business-cycle dynamics. A principal conclusion is that the agency-cost model replicates the empirical fact that output growth displays positive autocorrelation at short horizons. This hump-shaped output behavior arises because households delay their investment decisions until agency costs are at their lowest-a point in time several periods after the initial shock.

AB When optimal monetary policy is subject to a credibility problem, it is often argued that the government should appoint a central banker whose incentives differ from the government's. I argue, however, that such delegation does not overcome credibility problems given that delegation is discretionary and without costs. "Reappointment costs" of delegation are shown to improve suboptimal outcomes, but credibility of optimal monetary policy turns out to be worsened. At best, delegation therefore has no effects on credibility, but only if reappointment has no costs.

AB In all industrial countries, fiscal policy is increasingly about redistribution. In this paper, we study redistribution across different types of agents in a world characterized by the presence of labor unions and distortionary taxation. We show that an increase in transfers financed by distortionary taxation has nonlinear effects on unit labor costs relative to the other countries, depending on the degree of centralization of the wage-setting process in the labor market. We find considerable empirical support for the model in a sample of 14 OECD countries.

AB We develop a model in which stares may choose to form coalitions to capture efficiency gains from policy coordination. Joining a coalition entails setting the policy variable to maximize the coalition's aggregate payoff a Nash equilibrium against nonmembers, and to commit to a transfer scheme to share the gains. With two states, the unique equilibrium structure is complete federation; with more than two states, incomplete federation can be the unique equilibrium. Interpreting this result in terms of customs unions, the trend to trading-bloc formation may be equilibrium behavior even with cooperation and transfers within customs unions.

ID DIVIDED PARTY CONTROL; TERM LIMITS; GOVERNMENT
AB In U.S. elections, voters often vote for candidates from different parties for president and Congress. Voters also express dissatisfaction with the performance of Congress as a whole and satisfaction with their own representative. We develop a model of split-ticket voting in which government spending is financed by uniform taxes. The benefits from this spending are concentrated. While the model generates split-ticket voting, overall spending is too high only if the president's powers are limited. Overall spending is too high in a parliamentary system. Our model can be used as the basis of an argument for term limits.

In particular, we find that certain types of institutions-those that become more "politically unstable" as citizen heterogeneity increases-perform relatively poorly given a single jurisdiction, yet these same institutions perform relatively well when there are multiple jurisdictions. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon which draws upon simulated annealing, a discrete nonlinear search algorithm.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFERS; FAMILIES; PROVISION; EXCHANGE; CHILDREN;
   BEHAVIOR; BEQUESTS; WEALTH; MODEL
AB This paper uses PSID data on the extended family to test whether inter vivos transfers from parents to children are motivated by altruism. Specifically, the paper tests whether an increase by one dollar in the income of parents actively making transfers to a child coupled with a one-dollar reduction in that child's income results in the parents' increasing their transfer to the child by one dollar. This restriction on parental and child transfer-income derivatives is derived for the standard altruism model augmented to include uncertainty and liquidity constraints. These additional elements pin down the timing of inter vivos transfers. The method used to estimate income-transfer derivatives takes into account unobserved heterogeneity across families in the degree of altruism. The findings strongly reject the altruism hypothesis. Redistributing one dollar from a recipient child to donor parents leads to less than a 13-cent increase in the parents' transfer to the child, far less than the one-dollar increase implied by altruism.

TI Risk taking by mutual funds as a response to incentives
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; TOURNAMENTS; INVESTMENT; INDUSTRY; BEHAVIOR; MARKET
AB This paper examines a potential agency conflict between mutual fund investors and mutual fund companies. Investors would like the fund company to use its judgment to maximize risk-adjusted fund returns. A fund company, however, in its desire to maximize its value as a concern, has an incentive to take actions that increase the inflow of investments. We use a semiparametric model to estimate the shape of the flow-performance relationship for a sample of growth and growth and income funds observed over the 1982-92 period. The shape of the flow-performance relationship creates incentives for fund managers to increase or decrease the riskiness of the fund that are dependent on the fund's year-to-date return. We examine portfolio holdings of mutual funds in September and December and show that mutual funds do alter the riskiness of their portfolios at the end of the year in a manner consistent with these incentives.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

ID EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTRACTION
AB The theory of resource extraction has focused primarily on extraction when there is a single, homogeneous demand for the resource. In reality, however, we observe the simultaneous extraction of different resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas and multiple demands such as transportation, residential and commercial heating, and electricity generation. This paper develops a model with multiple resources and grades and multiple demands. The model is simulated with extraction cost, estimated reserves, and energy demand data for the world economy. It is shown that if historical rates of cost reduction in the production of solar energy are maintained, more than 90 percent of the world's coal will never be used. The world will move from oil and natural gas use to solar energy. Global temperatures will rise by only about 1.5-2 degrees centigrade by the middle of the next century and then decline steadily to preindustrial levels, even without carbon taxes. These results are significantly lower than those predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and suggest that the case for global warming may be seriously overstated.

AB Using Current Population Survey data from November 1979 and 1989, I find that Mexican Americans earn low wages primarily because they possess less human capital than other-workers, not because they receive smaller labor market rewards for their skills. Among third-and higher-generation men in 1989, Mexicans averaged 21 percent lower wages than non-Hispanic whites, which is roughly similar to the wage deficit for blacks. For Mexicans, more than three-quarters of the wage gap is attributable to their relative youth, English language deficiencies, and especially their lower educational attainment. By contrast, these variables explain less than a third of the black-white wage gap.

ID RETIREMENT
AB I investigate the factors that fostered the rise in separate living quarters for the aged prior to Social Security by estimating the income effect of the first major pension program in the United States, that covering Union Army veterans. I find that income substantially increased demand for separate living arrangements, suggesting that prior to 1940 rising incomes were the most important factor enabling the elderly to live alone. Comparisons with recent studies imply that income no longer plays as large a role, perhaps because income levels are now higher and independent living is both less expensive and more attractive.

AB A random-matching model of money is used to deduce the effects of a once-for-all change in the quantity of money. It is shown that the change has short-run effects that are predominantly real and long-run effects that are in the direction of being predominantly nominal provided that the change is random and people learn its realization only with a lag. The change in the quantity of money comes about through a random process of discovery that does not permit anyone to deduce the aggregate amount discovered when the change actually occurs.

Using long-term historical data for 15 countries, we find that, under fiat standards, the growth rates of various monetary aggregates are more highly correlated with inflation and with each other than under commodity standards. Money growth, inflation, and output growth are also higher. In contrast, we do not find that money growth is more highly correlated with output growth under one standard than under the other.

DT Article
AB It is argued that Schumpeter's widely accepted judgment that Pareto's work is ''completely rooted in Walras's system'' constitutes a misreading of Pareto. In fact, already during the period 1892-1900, Pareto traces the methodological outlines of an economic science profoundly different from that of Walras. It is maintained that his methodological contribution represents an attempt to define the conditions for political economy to be a science. In this context, Pareto examines the theoretical premises of economic theories and questions the hypotheses of per-feet foresight and rationality. The ordinalist hypothesis is also shown to be a consequence of these methodological reflections.

We then consider a sequence of auctions A(r) with n(r) bidders and k(r) objects. We show that price converges in probability to the true value of the object if and only if both k(r) --> infinity and n(r) - k(r) --> infinity, i.e., both the number of objects and the number of bidders who do not receive an object go to infinity.

AB A number of papers have shown that a strict Nash equilibrium action profile of a game may never be played if there is a small amount of incomplete information (see, for example, Carlsson and van Damme (1993a)). We present a general approach to analyzing the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information. A Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. We show that many games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why we get such different results from existing refinements. If a game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is robust. A natural many-player many-action generalization of risk dominance is a sufficient condition for robustness.

ID NONPARAMETRIC APPROACH; IDENTIFICATION
AB The standard formalization of the econometric analysis of treatment response assumes that each member of a population of interest receives one of a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive treatments. and that the outcome under the realized treatment is observable. Outcomes under the nonrealized treatments are necessarily unobservable; hence these outcomes are censored. This paper investigates what may be learned about treatment response when it is assumed that response functions are monotone, semi-monotone, or concave-monotone. The analysis assumes nothing about the process of treatment selection and imposes no cross-individual restrictions on response. The basic idea is to determine, for every member of the population, the set of response functions that pass through that person's realized (treatment, outcome) pair and that are consistent with the functional-form assumption imposed. These person-specific findings are then explicitly aggregated across the population to determine what can be learned about the distribution of response. The findings have application to the econometric analysis of market demand and of production.

AB We consider the problem of estimation in a panel data sample selection model, where both the selection and the regression equation of interest contain unobservable individual-specific effects. We propose a two-step estimation procedure, which ''differences out'' both the sample selection effect and the unobservable individual effect from the equation of interest. In the first step, the unknown coefficients of the ''selection'' equation are consistently estimated. The estimates are then used to estimate the regression equation of interest. The estimator proposed in this paper is consistent and asymptotically normal, with a rate of convergence that can be made arbitrarily close to n(-1/2), depending on the strength of certain smoothness assumptions. The finite sample properties of the estimator are investigated in a small Monte Carlo simulation.

AB General characterizations of valid confidence sets and tests in problems which involve locally almost unidentified (LAU) parameters are provided and applied to several econometric models. Two types of inference problems are studied: (i) inference about parameters which are not identifiable on certain subsets of the parameter space, and (ii) inference about parameter transformations with discontinuities. When a LAU parameter or parametric function has an unbounded range, it is shown under general regularity conditions that any valid confidence set with level 1 - alpha for this parameter must be unbounded with probability close to 1 - alpha in the neighborhood of nonidentification subsets and will have a nonzero probability of being unbounded under any distribution compatible with the model: no valid confidence set which is almost surely bounded does exist. These properties hold even if ''identifying restrictions'' are imposed. Similar results also obtain for parameters with bounded ranges. Consequently, a confidence set which does not satisfy this characterization has zero coverage probability (level). This will be the case in particular for Wald-type confidence intervals based on asymptotic standard errors. Furthermore, Wald-type statistics for testing given values of a LAU parameter cannot be pivotal functions (i.e., they have distributions which depend on unknown nuisance parameters) and even cannot be usefully bounded over the space of the nuisance parameters. These results are applied to several econometric problems: inference in simultaneous equations (instrumental variables (IV) regressions), linear regressions with autoregressive errors, inference about long-run multipliers and cointegrating vectors. For example, it is shown that standard ''asymptotically justified'' confidence intervals based on IV estimators (such as two-stage least squares) and the associated ''standard errors'' have zero coverage probability, and the corresponding t statistics have distributions which cannot be bounded by any finite set of distribution functions, a result of interest for interpreting IV regressions with ''weak instruments.'' Furthermore, expansion methods (e.g., Edgeworth expansions) and bootstrap techniques cannot solve these difficulties. Finally, in a number of cases where Wald-type methods are fundamentally flawed (e.g., IV regressions with poor instruments), it is observed that likelihood-based methods (e.g., likelihood-ratio tests and confidence sets) combined with projection techniques can easily yield valid tests and confidence sets.

AB This paper develops a search-theoretic model of technological change that accounts for some puzzling trends in industrial research, patenting, and productivity growth. In the model, researchers sample from probability distributions of potential new production techniques. Past research generates a technological frontier representing the best techniques for producing each good in the economy. Technological breakthroughs, resulting in patents, become increasingly hard to find as the technological frontier advances. This explains why patenting has been roughly constant as research employment has risen sharply over the last forty years. Productivity is determined by the position of the technological frontier and hence by the stock of past research. If researchers sample from Pareto distributions. then productivity growth is proportional to the growth of the research stock. The Pareto specification accounts for why productivity growth has neither risen as research employment has grown nor fallen as patenting has failed to grow. The growth of research employment itself is driven, in equilibrium, by population growth. Calibrating the model's four parameters, the implied social return to research is over twenty percent.

AB We identify sufficient conditions which guarantee that aggregate demand is approximately linear in income and satisfies a restricted form of the law of demand in a market where income is price dependent. The conditions involve the way preferences are distributed: loosely speaking, preferences have to be sufficiently heterogeneous. The definition of heterogeneity we use is similar to Grandmont (1992) but it is applied to homothetic transformations as introduced in Jerison (1982) and Grandmont (1987) and allows for the possibility of atoms. Another condition is that the distributions of preferences and income are independent. In exchange and production economies, our result guarantees the uniqueness of the price equilibrium and its stability under the Walras' tatonnement.

TI Alarmist decisions with divergent risk information
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Receipt of multiple sources of risk information ideally should foster sounder decisions under uncertainty. This paper's original survey results for environmental risks suggest that the learning process is reasonable in many respects, bur it does not accord with a rational Bayesian learning model. Divergent risk assessments from different sources produce extreme violations of rationality, as there is inordinate weight on the high risk assessment. This alarmist reaction holds for both government and industry information sources. This phenomenon may account for the commonly observed phenomenon of public overreaction to highly publicised risks.

AB The effects of risk aversion are examined for two types of expenditures in rent-seeking contests: (a) Rent-Seeking Expenditures, which improve the probability that the rent is obtained;and (b) Rent-Augmenting Expenditures, which increase the size of the rent to be awarded. Risk aversion is shown to reduce expenditures of type (b) unambiguously, while having an indeterminate effect on those of type (a). These two contrasting results are shown to derive from the very different effects rent-seeking and rent-augmenting expenditures have on the riskiness of a player's position.

AB We report and compare results from several different versions of an experimental interactive guessing game first studied by Nagel (1995), which we refer to as the 'beauty contest' game following Keynes (1936). In these games, groups of subjects are repeatedly asked to simultaneously guess a real number in the interval [0, 100] that they believe will be closest to 1/2 times either the median, mean, or maximum of all numbers chosen. We also use our experimental data to test a simple model of adaptive learning behaviour.

AB The often volatile behaviour of UK house prices between 1957 and 1994 is analysed in an annual econometric model. Theory suggests that, financial liberalisation of mortgage markets in the 1980s should have led to notable shifts in house price behaviour, The evidence supports the predictions of theory, suggesting shifts took place in wealth effects, as in the consumption function, and that real interest rates and income expectations became more important. The presence of transactions costs suggests important nonlinearities in house price dynamics. The paper also contains an explicit econometric treatment of expectations, demography, supply spillovers from the rented sector and of composition biases in the official house price index.

We present and test a model in which prices reflect expectations of exchange rate behaviour. The results provide mixed evidence that price-setting in countries which participated in the ERM was influenced by the exchange rate discipline.

AB The extent of multinational activity and the share of world trade accounted for by multinational enterprises has risen steadily over the past two decades. This has led to renewed interest within Europe in the impact of multinational enterprises on employment, investment and trade, and the structure of economic growth. In this paper we discuss the factors behind the continued growth of foreign direct investment and its wider consequences on home and host economies. We report evidence on the impact of production relocation on the export performance of a number of OECD economies, and investigate the extent ro which technology transfer from foreign-owned firms has affected the rate of technical progress within the German and UK economies. The acquistion of firm-specific knowledge-based assets is found to be an important factor behind the growth of FDI, suggesting that such investments are likely to be an important channel for the diffusion of ideas and technologies.

AB We compare the relation between foreign affiliate production and parent employment in US manufacturing multinationals with that in Swedish firms. US multinationals appear to have allocated some of their more labour-intensive operations selling in world markets to affiliates in developing countries, reducing the labour intensity in their home production. Swedish multinationals produce relatively little in developing countries and most of that has been for sale within host countries with import-substituting trade regimes. The great majority of Swedish affiliate production is in high-income countries, the United States and Europe, and is associated with more employment, particularly blue-collar employment, in the parent companies. The small Swedish-owned production that does take place in developing countries is also associated with more white-collar employment at home. The effects on white-collar employment within the Swedish firms have grown smaller and weaker over time.

ID REFORM; FIRMS
AB Generating government revenue is a common objective in privatization. This paper asks what determines privatization prices using firm-level data for all 236 Mexican companies privatized between 1983 and 1992. There are three main reasons why net prices-auction prices net of the cost of prior restructuring measures-are low, averaging 54 cents per dollar of assets. First, privatization prices are very sensitive to the level of competition in the auction and restrictions often Limited participation. Second, the privatization process took too long, and lengthier privatizations are associated with lower premiums. Third, firm prior restructuring measures absorbed an average of 33 percent of the auction price. Most restructuring measures do not increase price and delay privatization further. Net prices would have increased by 71 cents per dollar of assets if the government had emphasized speed, succeeding in divesting assets in one year less than the average, and firing the CEO were the only restructuring step taken.

A basic trade-off between the efficiency gains of unification and the costs in terms of loss of control on political decisions is highlighted. The model emphasizes political conflicts over redistribution policies. The main results of the paper are i) when income distributions vary across regions and the efficiency gains from unification are small, separation occurs in equilibrium; and ii) when all factors of production are perfectly mobile, all incentives for separation disappear.

ID TRANSITION; ECONOMIES
AB Under central planning, many firms relied on a single supplier for critical inputs. Transition has led to decentralized bargaining between suppliers and buyers. Under incomplete contracts or asymmetric information, bargaining may inefficiently break down, and if chains of production link many specialized producers, output will decline sharply. Mechanisms that mitigate these problems in the West, such as reputation, can only play a limited role in transition. The empirical evidence suggests that output has fallen farthest for the goods with the most complex production process, and that disorganization has been more important in the former Soviet Union than in Central Europe.

ID INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP; FIRM
AB When should a government provide a service in-house, and when should it contract out provision? We develop a model in which the provider can invest in improving the quality of service or reducing cost. If contracts are incomplete, the private provider has a stronger incentive to engage in both quality improvement and cost reduction than a government employee has. However, the private contractor's incentive to engage in cost reduction is typically too strong because he ignores the adverse effect on noncontractible quality. The model is applied to understanding the costs and benefits of prison privatization.

AB Political constitutions are incomplete contracts and therefore leave room for abuse of power. In democracies, elections are the primary mechanism for disciplining public officials, but they are not sufficient. Separation of powers between executive and legislative bodies also helps to prevent the abuse of power, but only with appropriate checks and balances. Checks and balances work by creating a conflict of interest between the executive and the legislature, yet requiring both bodies to agree on public policy. In this way, the two bodies discipline each other to the voters' advantage. Under appropriate checks and balances, separation of powers also helps the voters elicit information.

We show that these problems are exacerbated at low levels of development and in bureaucracies dealing with poor people. we also argue that we need to posit the existence of a welfare-oriented constituency within the government in order to explain red tape and corruption.

ID LOCATION
AB This paper discusses the prevalence of Silicon Valley-style localizations of individual manufacturing industries in the United States. A model in which localized industry-specific spillovers, natural advantages, and pure random chance all contribute to geographic concentration is used to develop a test for whether observed levels of concentration are greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate new indices of geographic concentration and of coagglomeration. The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized. In many industries, however, the degree of localization is slight. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the coagglomeration of related industries and of industries with strong upstream-downstream ties.

Banks lower the cost of giving investors rapid access to their capital and improve the liquidity of markets by diverting demand for liquidity from markets. Increased participation in markets causes the banking sector to shrink, primarily through reduced holdings of long-term assets. In addition, increased participation leads to longer-maturity real and financial assets and a smaller gap between the maturity of financial and real assets.

AB A traditional argument against a balanced-budget fiscal policy rule is that it amplifies business cycles by stimulating aggregate demand during booms via tax cuts and higher public expenditures and by reducing demand during recessions through a corresponding fiscal contraction. This paper suggests an additional source of instability that may arise from this ripe of fiscal policy rule, It shows that: within the standard neoclassical growth model, a balanced-budget rule can make expectations of higher tax rates self-fulfilling if the fiscal authority relies heavily on changes in labor income taxes to eliminate short-run fiscal imbalances. Calibrated versions of the model show that indeterminacy occurs for income tax rates that are empirically plausible for the U.S. economy and other Group of Seven countries.

AB Corrupt agents (officials or gangsters) exact money from firms. Corruption affects the number of firms in a free-entry equilibrium. The degree of deep competition in the economy increases with lower overhead costs relative to profits and with a tendency toward similar cost structures. Increases in competition may not lower corruption. The model explains why a rational corrupt agent may extinguish the source of his bribe income by causing a firm to exit. Assessing the welfare effect of corruption is complicated by the fact that exit caused by corruption does not necessarily reduce social welfare.

AB We consider a model of the stock market with delegated portfolio management. Managers try, but sometimes fail, to discover profitable trading opportunities. Although it is best not to trade in this case, their clients cannot distinguish ''actively doing nothing,'' in this sense, from ''simply doing nothing.'' Because of this problem, (i) some portfolio managers trade even though they have no reason to prefer one asset to another (noise trade). We also show that (ii) the amount of such noise trade can be large compared to the amount of hedging volume. Perhaps surprisingly, (iii) noise trade may be Pareto-improving, Noise trade may be viewed as a public good. Results i and ii are compatible with observed high levels of turnover in securities markets. Result iii illustrates some of the possible subtleties of the welfare economics of financial markets. In our model, all agents are rational: some trade for hedging reasons, investors optimally contract with portfolio managers who may have stock-picking abilities, and portfolio managers trade optimally given the incentives provided by this contract.

The large volume of intra-OECD trade is frequently cited as critical evidence on this question. It is argued that comparative advantage, unlike scale economies, is incapable of accounting for the large volume of trade between seemingly similar economies. This is a theoretical claim. In this paper, I show that it is possible to give an account of this trade based on comparative advantage. The elements that may give rise to a large volume of North-North trade are traced to identifiable features of technology and endowments.

Firms headquartered in counties with high wages hold more money for a given lever of sales, a finding consistent with the idea that time can substitute for money in the provision of transactions services.

This paper finds that there were marked improvements in the marginal productivity of factors and in TFP between 1980 and 1989. More important, the evidence shows that over 87 percent of the TFP growth was attributable to improved incentives, intensified product market competition, and improved factor allocation.

AB The conventional approach to social programme evaluation focuses on estimating mean impacts of programmes. Yet many interesting questions regarding the political economy of programmes, the distribution of programme benefits and the option values conferred on programme participants require knowledge of the distribution of impacts, or features of it. This paper presents evidence that heterogeneity in response to programmes is empirically important and that classical probability inequalities are not very informative in producing estimates or bounds on the distribution of programme impacts. We explore two methods for supplementing the information in these inequalities based on assumptions about participant decision-making processes and about the strength in dependence between outcomes in the participation and non-participation states. Dependence is produced as a consequence of rational choice by participants. We test for stochastic rationality among programme participants and present and implement methods for estimating the option values of social programmes.

AB A common concern of evaluation studies is to learn the distribution of outcomes when a specified treatment policy, or assignment rule, determines the treatment received by each member of a specified population. Recent studies have emphasized evaluation of policies providing the same treatment to all members of the population. In particular, experiments with randomized treatments have this objective. Social programmes mandating homogeneous treatment of the population are of interest, but so are ones in which treatment varies across the population. This paper examines the use of empirical evidence on programmes with homogeneous treatments to infer the outcomes that would occur if treatment were to vary across the population. Experimental evidence from the Ferry Pre-school Project is used to illustrate the inferential problem and the main findings of the analysis.

AB In Imbens and Ingrist (1994), Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996) and Imbens and Rubin (1997), assumptions have been outlined under which instrumental variables estimands can be given a causal interpretation as a local average treatment effect without requiring functional form or constant treatment effect assumptions. We extend these results by showing that under these assumptions one can estimate more from the data than the average causal effect for the subpopulation of compliers; one can, in principle, estimate the entire marginal distribution of the outcome under different treatments for this subpopulation. These distributions might be useful for a policy maker who wishes to take into account not only differences in average of earnings when contemplating the merits of one job training programme vs. another. We also show that the standard instrumental variables estimator implicitly estimates these underlying outcome distributions without imposing the required nonnegativity on these implicit density estimates, and that imposing nonnegativity can substantially alter the estimates of the local average treatment effect. We illustrate these points by presenting an analysis of the returns-to a high school education using quarter of birth as an instrument. We show that the standard instrumental variables estimates implicitly estimate the outcome distributions to be negative over a substantial range, and that the estimates of the local average treatment effect change considerably when we impose nonnegativity in any of a variety of ways.

TI Bounding causal effects using data from a contaminated natural
   experiment: Analysing the effects of teenage childbearing
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID WOMENS EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; SPONTANEOUS-ABORTIONS; 1ST BIRTH;
   IDENTIFICATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB In this paper, we consider what can be learned about causal effects when one uses a contaminated instrumental variable. In particular, we consider what inferences can be made about the causal effect of teenage childbearing on a teen mother's subsequent outcomes when we use the natural experiment of miscarriages to form an instrumental variable for teen births. Miscarriages might not meet all of the conditions required for an instrumental variable to identify such causal effects for all of the observations in our sample. However, it is an appropriate instrumental variable for some women, namely those pregnant women who experience a random miscarriage. Although information from typical data sources does not allow one to identify these women, we show that one can adapt results from Horowitz and Manski (1995) on identification with data from contaminated samples to construct informative bounds on the causal effect of teenage childbearing. We use these bounds to re-examine the effects of early chilbearing on the teen mother's subsequent educational and labour market attainment as considered in Hotz, McElroy and Sanders (1995a, 1995b). Consistent with their study, these bounds indicate that women who have births as teens have higher labour market earnings and hours worked compared to what they would have attained if their childbearing had been delayed.

TI Matching as an econometric evaluation estimator: Evidence from
   evaluating a job training programme
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL PROGRAMS; SELECTION BIAS; EARNINGS; REGRESSION; IMPACT
AB This paper considers whether it is possible to devise a nonexperimental procedure for evaluating a prototypical job training programme. Using rich nonexperimental data, we examine the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a) estimates the probability that a person participates in a programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying assumptions that justify the classical method of matching. We present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences extension of the method of matching that is consistent with the classical index-sufficient sample selection model and is not rejected by our tests of identifying assumptions. This estimator is effective in eliminating bias, especially when it is due to temporally-invariant omitted variables.

AB We address two questions using experimental data on disadvantaged women. First, what is the impact of being offered JTPA classroom training on the duration of unemployment and employment? Second, what is the effect of actually participating in this training on the length of such spells? Belonging to the treatment group shortens unemployment spells but has no effect on employment spells. Actually participating in training has a larger positive effect on the exit rate from unemployment than the effect of simply being a member of the treatment group. Ignoring the endogeneity of actual training in estimation substantially underestimates its effect.

TI Evaluating the impact of French employment policies on individual labour

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAINING-PROGRAMS; DURATION MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; EARNINGS
AB This paper deals with the evaluation of some public employment policies set up in France during the 1980's to improve the labour market prospects of unskilled young workers. The evaluation implemented in this paper is restricted to the impact of such public measures on durations and outcomes of subsequent spells of unemployment and employment. The econometric study is conducted with non-experimental longitudinal microdata recording individual labour market histories. A particular attention is paid to the differential effects of various types of measures, according to the educational level of recipients. Programmes involving a higher level of on-the-job training, such as alternating work/training programmes in private firms, are principally beneficial to the less educated young workers. In contrast, for more educated young workers, ''work fare'' programmes in the public sector decrease the intensity of transition from the subsequent unemployment spell to regular jobs; for that subgroup, ''work fare'' programmes may act as a signal of low employment performance.

ID LEONTIEF; TRADE
AB The neoclassical model of trade predicts that international specialization will be jointly determined by cross-country differences in relative factor endowments and technology levels. This paper specifies an empirical model of specialization consistent with the neoclassical explanation. In the model, a sector's share of GDP depends on relative factor supplies and relative technology differences, and the estimated parameters of the model have a clear connection to theoretical parameters. The model is estimated with panel data on manufacturing sectors in industrialized countries. Relative technology levels and factor supplies are both found to be important determinants of specialization.

AB This paper demonstrates that bilateral free-trade agreements can undermine political support for further multilateral trade liberalization. If a bilateral trade agreement offers disproportionately large gains to key agents in a country, then their reservation utility is raised above the multilateral free-trade level, and a multilateral agreement would be blocked. Bilateral agreements between countries with similar factor endowments are most likely to have this effect. It also follows that bilateral free-trade agreements can never increase political support for multilateral free trade.

This paper quantifies the effect of prior exporting experience on the decisions of Colombian manufacturing plants to participate in foreign markets. It develops a dynamic discrete-choice model of exporting behavior that separates the roles of profit heterogeneity and sunk entry costs in explaining plants' exporting status. Stink costs are found to be significant, and prior export experience is shown to increase the probability of exporting by as much as 60 percentage points.

A model of adverse selection based on information advantages for private owners demonstrates how privatization can improve the quality and number of western managers in eastern enterprises. These benefits can increase with the size of the transition. Evidence of management replacement and significant differences between state-owned and privatized firms from a survey of eastern German firms supports model assumptions and predictions. These results suggest the importance of management replacement to successful privatization.

AB Two fundamentally different subcontracting systems arise as distinct solutions to the quality control problem facing an input buyer. The ''American'' system involves competitive bidding on each contract, large orders, and inspections. The ''Japanese'' system involves repeat purchases from a supplier who earns a premium, small orders, and no inspections. Both systems may coexist as local solutions, but the global optimum is determined by the ratio of set-up to inspection casts. This suggests that the adoption of flexible manufacturing equipment and rising product complexity may be responsible for the shift from the American to the Japanese system observed in many industries.

We compare minimum resale price maintenance (RPM) to retail market-clearing in a model with a monopolistic manufacturer selling to competitive retailers. In both the RPM and flexible-price games, retailers must order inventories before the realization of demand uncertainty. We find that manufacturer profits and equilibrium inventories are higher under RPM than under market-clearing. Surprisingly, consumer surplus can also be higher, in which case unfettered retail competition can legitimately be called ''destructive.''

Strategic behavior by firms tends to reduce output, R&D and welfare and so justifies higher subsidies except when R&D spillovers are low and firms' actions are strategic substitutes. It also reduces the benefits of R&D cooperation. Moreover, policies to encourage cooperation are likely to be redundant (since it is always privately profitable) and simulations suggest that the welfare cost of lax competition policy is high.

Such behavior is seen frequently in auctions, yet would be suboptimal within most existing models. Here, the seller uses resale to signal information about the object's value that could not easily be communicated via a reserve price announcement. The model predicts that bids for reauctioned objects increase relative to initial bids and that, on average, prices of both reauctioned items and those sold at initial auction rise as delay in reauctioning increases.

Otherwise, truthful reporting forces a third best, characterized by provider ''prospective payment'' and suboptimal effort, while consumers' demand becomes excessive. We also analyze how ''professional ethics'' alters the equilibrium. Finally, collusive reporting mechanisms imply more stringent constraints, while competition among physicians relaxes them.

More favorable results are obtained for the ''family investment model,'' in which wives in immigrant families take on ''dead-end'' jobs to finance their husbands' investments in human capital. We conclude that family composition is an important correlate of immigrants' assimilation, and the family investment model can account for many of the patterns in the data.

AB A model of social distance is presented that is useful for understanding social decisions. Status and conformity in previous models are discussed, and then a generalization is described. In this generalization agents have inherited positions in social space and an expected value of trade between two individuals as a function of the difference in their initial positions. An example of this system is constructed in which there is class stability. Agents who are initially close interact strongly while those who are socially distant have little interaction. In this example inherited social position, which may be interpreted as social class, plays a dominant role. The relevance of this model to social decisions such as the choice of educational attainment and childbearing is discussed in the context of specific ethnographic examples. Class position may play a dominant role in these decisions.

ID CONDORCET JURY THEOREM; MODEL
AB We analyze two-candidate elections in which voters are uncertain about the realization of a state variable that affects the utility of all voters. Each voter has noisy private information about the state variable. We show that the fraction of voters whose vote depends on their private information goes to zero as the size of the electorate goes to infinity. Nevertheless, elections fully aggregate information in the sense that the chosen candidate would not change if all private information were common knowledge. Equilibrium voting behavior is to a large extent determined by the electoral rule, i.e., if a candidate is required to get at least x percent of the vote in order to win the election, then in equilibrium this candidate gets very close to x percent of the vote with probability close to one. Finally, if the distribution from which preferences are drawn is uncertain, then elections will generally not satisfy full information equivalence and the fraction of voters who take informative action does not converge to zero.

ID BUSINESS CYCLES; DYNAMICS; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB The concept of adaptively rational equilibrium (A.R.E.) is introduced. Agents adapt their beliefs over time by choosing from a finite set of different predictor or expectations functions. Each predictor is a function of past observations and has a performance or fitness measure which is publicly available. Agents make a rational choice concerning the predictors based upon their past performance. This results in a dynamics across predictor choice which is coupled to the equilibrium dynamics of the endogenous variables.
   As a simple, but typical, example we consider a cobweb type demand supply model where agents can choose between rational and naive expectations. In an unstable market with (small) positive information costs for rational expectations, a high intensity of choice to switch predictors leads to highly irregular equilibrium prices converging to a strange attractor. The irregularity of the equilibrium time paths is explained by the existence of a so-called homoclinic orbit and its associated complicated dynamical phenomena. Thus local instability and global complicated dynamics may be a feature of a fully rational notion of equilibrium.

The test is an extension of the Kolmogorov test of goodness-of-fit for distribution functions. The test is shown to have power against 1/root n local alternatives and all fixed alternatives to the null hypothesis. A parametric bootstrap procedure is used to obtain critical values for the test.

ID MODEL-SPECIFICATION TESTS; NUISANCE PARAMETER; FUNCTIONAL FORM
AB In this paper we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic of a generalized version of the integrated conditional moment (ICM) test of Bierens (1982, 1984), under a class of root n-local alternatives, where n is the sample size. The generalized version involved includes neural network tests as a special case, and allows for testing misspecification of dynamic models.
   It appears that the ICM test has nontrivial local power. Moreover, for a class of ''large'' local alternatives the consistent ICM test is more powerful than the parametric t test in a neighborhood of the parametric alternative involved. Furthermore, under the assumption of normal errors the ICM test is asymptotically admissible, in the sense that there does not exist a test that is uniformly more powerful.
   The asymptotic size of the test is case-dependent: the critical values of the test depend on the data-generating process. In this paper we derive case-independent upperbounds of the critical values.

ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB This paper considers reputation effects in a repeated game between two long-run players, one of whom is relatively patient and may be committed to a fixed strategy which punishes the opponent for increasingly long periods whenever inappropriate actions are taken. By following this commitment strategy, the more patient player can induce a sufficiently patient opponent to experiment to see whether the commitment strategy is also being followed off the equilibrium path. This can guarantee the more patient player (in any Nash equilibrium) a payoff close to the highest feasible payoff consistent with the individual rationality of the other player. For an arbitrary degree of patience of the less patient player a weaker result is established: the more patient player is guaranteed an average equilibrium payoff close to the static Stackelberg payoff. This latter result generalizes that of Schmidt (1993), who established the same result for the restricted class of games of conflicting interests.

AB Allowing for incomplete information, this paper characterizes the social choice functions that can be approximated by the equilibrium outcomes of a mechanism: incentive compatibility is necessary and almost sufficient for virtual Bayesian implementability. In conjunction with a second condition, Bayesian incentive consistency, incentive compatibility is also sufficient. This new condition is weak-under standard topological and informational assumptions, it is satisfied by every social choice function. The type sets of the agents are taken to be arbitrary (possibly infinite) measurable spaces. An example shows that there are virtually (in fact, exactly) Bayesian implementable social choice functions that are not virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies.

However, less is known about forecasting when model and mechanism differ in a non-stationary and changing world. The paper addresses the basic concepts; the invariance of forecast accuracy measures to isomorphic model representations; the roles of causal information, parsimony and collinearity a reformulated taxonomy of forecast errors; differencing and intercept corrections to robustify forecasts against biases due to shifts in deterministic factors: the removal of structural breaks by co-breaking; and forecasting using leading indicators.

AB Motivated by recent developments in the bounded rationality and strategic complementarity literatures, we examine an intentionally simple and stylised aggregative economic model, when the assumptions of fully rational expectations and no strategic interactions are relaxed, We show that small deviations from rational expectations. taken alone, lead only to small deviations from classical policy -ineffectiveness, but that the situation can change dramatically when strategic complementarity is introduced. Strategic complementarity magnifies the effects of even small departures from rational expectations, producing equilibria with policy effectiveness, output persistence and multiplier effects.

ID WELFARE STIGMA; MODEL
AB In-work transfer schemes have recently been suggested as a device for encouraging labour force participation and reducing the severity of the disincentives associated with out-of-work income support schemes. Here we estimate a discrete choice labour supply model which allows for endogenous in-work welfare programme participation. We also allow for involuntary unemployment so as to distinguish between programme non-participation and an inability to obtain work and thereby generate an eligibility to the programme.

This paper uses cointegration techniques to test theories of price-setting on UK aggregate data for 1951-91. We find: (i) domestic prices are determined by both domestic costs and world prices and (ii) at the macroeconomic level, prices are related to marginal cost rather than average or normal cost.

AB The effects of the Uruguay Round are quantified using a numerical general equilibrium model which incorporates increasing returns to scale, 24 regions, 22 commodities, and steady state growth effects. we conclude that the aggregate welfare gains from the Round are in the order of $96 billion per year in the short run, but could be as high as $171 billion per year in the long run after capital stocks have optimally adjusted. Despite these global gains, we identify some developing countries that lose from the Round in the short run. In the long run, almost all gain, and the Round will allow developing countries to gain further through their own unilateral liberalisation.

AB By checking whether consumer demand satisfies the axioms of revealed preference, one can test the empirical validity of the neoclassical theory of consumer behaviour. However, applying the axioms to actual consumer purchase data is difficult, if not impossible, since it poses serious problems of both a methodological and a practical nature. After commenting on the few existing empirical studies in this field, we summarise the results from an experimental approach to revealed preference theory. Data were obtained through a controlled experiment that involved real consumption of the goods chosen. We find that most subjects violated the axioms.

ID MARKET
AB Our work attempts to investigate the influence of credit tightness or expansion on activity and relative prices in a multimarket set-up. We report on some double-auction, two-market experiments where subjects had to satisfy an inequality involving the use of credit. The experiments display two regimes, characterised by high and low credit availability. Our main results are that changes in the availability of credit: (a) have minor and unsystematic effects on quantities and relative prices in the high-credit regime; (b) have substantial effects, both on quantities and relative prices, in the low-credit regime.

AB This paper introduces the team dictator game to study whether social dynamics within a group can cause groups' decisions to differ systematically from individuals' decisions. In the individual dictator game, a subject dictates the allocation of y dollars; in the team dictator game, a team of two subjects dictates the allocation of 2y dollars. We derive and test competing predictions for the two dominant psychological theories of group polarisation in this context. The data indicate that team choices tend to be dominated by the more other-regarding member. This result is more consistent with Social Comparison Theory than Persuasive Argument Theory.

AB Allegations of bidder collusion at Forest Service timber sales in the Pacific Northwest were common in the 1970s. Of course, prices may be low for reasons other than collusion. We formulate an empirical model that allows for both bidder collusion and supply effects and in which we control for demand conditions. Noncooperative behavior in which a single unit is sold (the standard auction model) is a special case: it is found to be definitively outperformed by a model of collusion. We also find that supply effects are dominated by collusion in determining the winning bids in the market.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; INTERMEDIATION; MARKETS
AB This paper offers a theory of development that links the degree of market incompleteness to capital accumulation and growth. At early stages of development, the presence of indivisible projects limits the degree of risk spreading (diversification) that the economy can achieve. The desire to avoid highly risky investments slows down capital accumulation, and the inability to diversify idiosyncratic risk introduces a large amount of uncertainty in the growth process. The typical development pattern will consist of a lengthy period of ''primitive accumulation'' with highly variable output, followed by takeoff and financial deepening and, finally, steady growth. ''Lucky'' countries will spend relatively less time in the primitive accumulation stage and develop faster. Although all agents are price takers and there are no technological spillovers, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient because individuals do not take into account their impact on others' diversification opportunities. We also show that our results generalize to economies with international capital flows.

We apply this theory to the construction of a positive model of public finance, where organized special interests can lobby the government for consumer and producer taxes or subsidies and targeted lump-sum taxes or transfers. The lobbies use only the nondistorting transfers in their noncooperative equilibrium, but their intergroup competition for transfers turns into a prisoners' dilemma in which the government captures all the gain that is potentially available to the parties.

AB We extend the standard procurement model to examine how an agent is optimally induced to acquire valuable planning information before he chooses an unobservable level of cost-reducing effort. Concerns about information acquisition cause important changes in standard incentive contracts. Reward structures with extreme financial payoffs arise, and super-high-powered contracts are coupled with contracts that entail pronounced cost sharing. However, if the principal can assign the planning and production tasks to two different agents, then all contracting distortions disappear and, except for forgone economies of scope, the principal achieves her most preferred outcome.

ID TRADE; TIME
AB This paper reports the first experiments designed to explore the behavior of economies with prominent features of international finance. Two ''countries,'' each with its own currency, were created. International trade could take place only through the operation of markets for currency. The law of one price and the flow of funds theory of exchange rate determination were used to produce general equilibrium models that captured much of the behavior of the economies, Prices of goods, as well as the exchange rate,evolve over time toward the predictions of the models, However, both the law of one price and purchasing power parity can be rejected for reasons that do not appear in the literature. Patterns of international trade were as predicted by the law of comparative advantage.

AB Equilibrium models of real exchange rate determination in the presence of transactions costs imply a nonlinear adjustment process toward purchasing power parity (PPP). Conventional cointegration tests, which ignore the effect of transactions costs, may be biased against the long-run PPP hypothesis. Our results, using both monthly data for the interwar period and annual data spanning two centuries, clearly reject the linear framework in favor of an exponential smooth transition autoregressive process. The systematic pattern in the estimates of the nonlinear models provides strong evidence of mean-reverting behavior for PPP deviations and helps explain the mixed results of previous studies.

ID IMPERFECT INFORMATION; CREDIT MARKETS; BUSINESS CYCLES
AB We study an incentive model of financial intermediation in which firms as well as intermediaries are capital constrained. We analyze how the distribution of wealth across firms, intermediaries, and uninformed investors affects investment, interest rates, and the intensity of monitoring. We show that all forms of capital tightening (a credit crunch, a collateral squeeze, or a savings squeeze) hit poorly capitalized firms the hardest, but that interest rate effects and the intensity of monitoring will depend on relative changes in the various components of capital. The predictions of the model are broadly consistent with the lending patterns observed during the recent financial crises.

ID CORPORATE-CONTROL; OWNERSHIP; MARKET; BENEFITS; RIGHTS; COSTS
AB We propose that dispersed outside ownership and the resulting managerial discretion come with costs but also with benefits. Even when tight control by shareholders is ex post efficient, it constitutes ex ante an expropriation threat that reduces managerial initiative and noncontractible investments. In addition, we show that equity implements state contingent control, a feature usually associated with debt. Finally, we demonstrate that monitoring, and hence ownership concentration, may conflict with performance-based incentive schemes.

AB We model a consumer's efforts to reduce the discount on future utilities. Our analysis shows how wealth, mortality, addictions, uncertainty, and other variables affect the degree of time preference. In addition to working out many implications of the model, we discuss evidence on consumption, savings, equilibrium, and the dynamics of inequality. We claim that most of that evidence is consistent with the predictions of our approach.

AB A survey of 184 firms was conducted to investigate the reasons for wage rigidity. The strongest support was found for explanations based on adverse selection in quits and on the effect of wages on effort. In addition, survey respondents indicated that reducing turnover is an important explanation of wage rigidity for white-collar workers, and that implicit contracts are an important explanation for other workers. Respondents also believed that effort responds more strongly to wage decreases than to wage increases and that wage decreases have a greater impact on the effort of low-skilled workers than of high-skilled workers.

ID PRICE ADJUSTMENT; STICKY PRICES; INFLATION; MONEY; COMPETITION;
   ECONOMICS; OUTPUT; MODEL
AB We use store-level data to document the exact process of changing prices and to directly measure menu costs at five multistore supermarket chains. We show that changing prices in these establishments is a complex process, requiring dozens of steps and a nontrivial amount of resources. The menu costs average $105,887/year per store, comprising 0.70 percent of revenues, 35.2 percent of net margins, and $0.52/price change. These menu costs may be forming a barrier to price changes. Specifically, (1) a supermarket chain facing higher menu costs (due to item pricing laws that require a separate price tag on each item) changes prices two and one-half times less frequently than the other four chains; (2) within this chain the prices of products exempt from the law are changed over three times more frequently than the products subject to the law.
