AB This paper studies whether the dynamic behaviour of GNP growth, unemployment and inflation is systematically affected by the timing of elections and of changes of governments. The sample include the last three decades in 18 OECD economies. We explicitly test the implication of several models of political cycles, both of the "opportunistic" and of the "partisan" type. Also, we confront the implication of recent "rational" models with more traditional approaches. Our results can be summarized as follows: (a) The "political business cycle" hypothesis, as formulated in Nordhaus (1975) on output and unemployment is generally rejected by the data; (b) inflation tends to increase immediately after elections, perhaps as a result of pre-electoral expansionary monetary and fiscal policies; (c) we find evidence of temporary partisan differences in output and unemployment and of long-run partisan differences in the inflation rate as implied by the "rational partisan theory" by Alesina (1987); (d) we find virtually no evidence of permanent partisan differences in output growth and unemployment.

TI THE POLITICS OF 1992 - FISCAL-POLICY AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETITION
AB The internal market in Europe will greatly increase the international mobility of resources. How will this affect fiscal policy in different countries? We consider taxation of capital in a two-country model, where a democratically-chosen government in each country chooses tax policy. Higher capital mobility changes the politico-economic equilibrium in two ways. On the one hand, it leads to more tax competition between the countries: this "economic effect" tends to lower tax rates in both countries. On the other hand, it alters voters' preferences and makes them elect a different government: this "political effect" offsets the increased tax competition, although not completely.

TI ECONOMIC-REFORM AND DYNAMIC POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION; INFORMATION; MODELS
AB In this paper, we examine the impact of political constraints on economic reform plans, with special reference to the transition from centrally planned to market economies. We analyse the problem of an agenda-setting reform-minded Government facing a bureaucracy or industrial sector for which allocative efficiency requires redundancies and an increase in work intensity. The Government also tries to minimize the rents conceded to its heterogeneous workforce. We examine two types of political constraints: unanimity rule and majority rule, both in a one-period and a two-period horizon. The main results are the following. First of all, we show how adverse selection and time-consistency may generate the widely-observed feature of gradualism as an ingredient of an optimal reform. Second, under a majority rule, it is shown to be possible for the Government to obtain a majority vote for a reform scheme that intertemporally hurts majority interests. Indeed, the Government can improve rent extraction through the strategic use of the threat of future proposals: the group which expects to be in the minority tomorrow may accept concessions, while its votes can be used to extract rents from another group. These results suggest that, in a dynamic context, democratic constraints should not be overestimated as an obstacle against efficiency-enhancing economic reforms. The results of this paper may throw some light on the political economy of current reforms in Eastern Europe.

AB The cost of gathering information about unfamiliar securities may lead to gains from standardization: firms issue a particular security because it is used by other firms. To support standardization as an equilibrium phenomenon, information must be non-transferable (otherwise it might be revealed by prices or the observation of other agents' decisions) and it must be generic (useful in evaluating a number of securities). A competitive equilibrium in which standard contracts are used may be subject to coordination failure: while there always exists a constrained efficient equilibrium, there may also exist Pareto-ranked equilibria.

AB This paper examines the impact of placing natural restrictions on the mechanisms considered for implementation problems. It is shown that if all mechanisms are considered and preferences satisfy a basic condition, then any social choice correspondence can be implemented in undominated strategies. An example points out that the strength of this result derives from the use of mechanisms with questionable features. In part of the message space the agent who announces the highest integer is rewarded. This sort of "tail-chasing" construction, common in the constructive proofs of the literature, is used to assure that undesired strategy combinations do not form an equilibrium. If such mechanisms are ruled out, then the social choice correspondences which can be implemented in undominated strategies satisfy an incentive compatibility type condition called strategy-resistence. For social choice functions this is equivalent to strategy-proofness.
   This contrast suggests that this issue should be examined as it applies to other solution concepts used in implementation theory. The last portion of the paper begins to explore the issue as it relates to Nash implementation and undominated Nash implementation.

AB This article reconsiders the durable goods monopoly problem when the monopolist's marginal cost is private information. We show that the Coase Conjecture implies the No Trade Theorem: In any equilibrium in which the lowest-cost seller's initial offer approaches her marginal cost, the aggregate probability of trade must vanish. However, we also construct non-Coasean equilibria which approximate the unique outcome of the rental version of the same model. These (stationary) equilibria are comparatively efficient.
   The results are equally applicable to the mathematically-equivalent problem of sequential bargaining with two-sided incomplete information where one party makes all the offers.

AB A fixprice, non-Walrasian temporary equilibrium which co-exists with the Walrasian equilibrium at Walrasian temporary equilibrium prices, has been called "unsatisfactory" by Hahn. If consumers live, and work, for two periods, expectations of future unemployment easily (in particular with normal goods) generate unsatisfactory Keynesian unemployment equilibria, if these expectations reflect serial correlation in unemployment. Assuming that the choice of temporary equilibrium (Walrasian or Keynesian) is governed by an extraneous, "serially correlated" random variable (sunspots), a long-run equilibrium of an overlapping-generations model is presented which has persistent Walrasian prices, rational expectations and intermittent phases of Keynesian unemployment and Walrasian full employment.

In this setting, conflict is not the necessary outcome of one-time interaction, and cooperation is consistent with domination of one agent over another. Other things being equal, an agent's power, a well-defined concept in this paper, is inversely related to an agent's resources when resources are valued according to marginal-productivity theory. Some implications for the evolution of property rights are drawn. The model is applicable to a variety of situations in which directly unproductive activities are prevalent.

If, instead, firms offer identical product ranges, each consumer purchases from one firm only, because of costs of using additional suppliers, so the market may be less competitive and equilibrium prices higher. This contrasts with the standard intuition that firms minimize competition by differentiating their products.

We argue that high premiums can be attributed, at least in part, to large numbers of uninsured motorists in some markets, while uninsured motorists can be attributed to high premiums. We construct a simple noncooperative equilibrium model that can generate inefficient equilibria with uninsured drivers and high, yet actuarially fair, premiums. For certain parameterizations, an efficient full-insurance equilibrium and inefficient high-price equilibria with uninsured drivers exist simultaneously, helping to explain price variability across otherwise similar cities.

We show how a simple probabilistic process, in which chance influences a key unobserved determinant of R&D and firm size conditions the returns to R&D, can account for these regularities and other features of the distributions. The model provides a unified, noncausal explanation of a series of long-observed relationships across mean R&D intensity, market concentration, and the coefficient of variation. It also offers a novel explanation for the inverse relationship between R&D productivity and firm size.

ID INSTITUTIONS
AB This paper compares risk-taking of insured and uninsured thrifts operating under strict and less-strict regulatory regimes during the 1930's. Analysis of balance-sheet data indicates that while newly insured thrifts undertook less risk than their uninsured counterparts, possibly because of screening by deposit-insurance authorities, moral hazard emerged gradually. Insured institutions operating under relatively permissive regulatory regimes were more prone to undertake risky lending activities than their more tightly regulated counterparts. Given the current system of deposit insurance, the results suggest that effective regulation and supervision will play a key role in maintaining thrift stability in the 1990's.

Although the magnitude of output fluctuations has varied across countries and periods, relations among real quantities have been remarkably uniform. Properties of price levels, however, exhibit striking differences between periods Inflation rates are more persistent after World War II than before, and price-level fluctuations are typically procyclical before World War II and countercyclical afterward. Fluctuations in money are less highly correlated with output in the postwar period but are no more persistent than in earlier periods.

TI MACROECONOMIC SHOCKS IN A DYNAMIZED MODEL OF THE NATURAL RATE OF
   UNEMPLOYMENT
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB At the microeconomic level, this paper revises and broadens the theory of the equilibrium rate of unemployment, the "natural rate" in a monetary model We begin by recreating Salop's turnover model of the natural rate in its naturally intertemporal version. Useful findings on impact effects and the adjustment process at the individual firm, necessarily excluded by the static version, are shown to derive from the dynamized model. At the macroeconomic level, we then provide a general-equilibrium analysis of some shocks showing how they drive the equilibrium unemployment rate and in varying ways also disturb the real rate of interest.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; UNANTICIPATED MONEY; OUTPUT
AB We show that the interest rate on Federal funds is extremely informative about future movements of real macroeconomic variables. Then we argue that the reason for this forecasting success is that the funds rate sensitively records shocks to the supply of bank reserves; that is, the funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy actions. Finally, using innovations to the funds rate as a measure of changes in policy, we present evidence consistent with the view that monetary policy works at least in part through "credit " (i.e., bank loans) as well as through "money" (i.e., bank deposits).

AB A vast literature uses cross-country regressions to search for empirical linkages between long-run growth rates and a variety of economic policy, political, and institutional indicators. This paper examines whether the conclusions from existing studies are robust or fragile to small changes in the conditioning information set. We find that almost all results are fragile. We do, however, identify a positive, robust correlation between growth and the share of investment in GDP and between the investment share and the ratio of international trade to GDP. We clarify the conditions under which there is evidence of per capita output convergence.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB This paper revisits the hypothesis that technical change is embodied in capital. It extends old results to make them more relevant to the contemporary debates about the adjustment of investment goods for quality change and about the role of embodied technical change as a source of economic growth. It is shown that the failure to adjust capital for quality change has the effect of suppressing the quality effects into the conventional total-factor-productivity residual, and it is found that approximately 20 percent of the residual growth of quality-adjusted output could be attributed to embodied technical change.

AB We investigate the implementation of social choice functions in complete information environments. We consider social choice functions (scf's) which map from a finite set of preference profiles to lotteries over alternatives, and require virtual implementation in iteratively undominated strategies. An scf x is virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies if for all epsilon > 0, there exists an scf y which is epsilon-close to x (that is, for all preference profiles, x and y map to lotteries which are within epsilon of one another) and which is (exactly) implementable in iteratively undominated strategies. Under very weak domain restrictions we show that if there are three or more players, any scf is virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies. A noteworthy feature of our constructions is that we only employ finite mechanisms. As a corollary, we obtain virtual implementation in (pure and) mixed strategy Nash equilibrium using well-behaved (in particular, finite) mechanisms.
   The literature on implementation in Nash equilibrium and its refinements is compromised by its reliance on game forms with unnatural features (for example, "integer" games), or "modulo" constructions with mixed strategies arbitrarily excluded. In contrast, our results allow for mixed strategies and do not rely on mechanisms with obviously suspicious features.

AB A fixed group of n agents share a one input, one output technology with decreasing returns. We propose the following cost sharing formula. Agent 1 with the lowest demand of output q1 pays (1/n)th of the cost of nq1. Agent 2, with the next lowest demand q2 pays agent 1's cost share plus 11(n - 1)th of the incremental cost from nq1 to (n - 1)q2 + q1. Agent 3, with the next lowest demand q3 Pays agent 2's cost share, plus 1/(n - 2)th of the incremental cost from (n - 1)q2 + q1 to (n - 2)q3 + q2 + q1. And so on.
   Among agents endowed with convex and monotonic preferences, serial cost sharing is dominance solvable and its unique equilibrium is also robust to coalitional deviations. We show that no other smooth cost sharing mechanism yields a unique Nash equilibrium at all preference profiles.

AB This paper studies the class of denumerable-armed (i.e. finite- or countably infinite-armed) bandit problems with independent arms and geometric discounting over an infinite horizon, in which each arm generates rewards according to one of a finite number of distributions, or "types." The number of types in the support of an arm, as also the types themselves, are allowed to vary across the arms. We derive certain continuity and curvature properties of the dynamic allocation (or Gittins) index of Gittins and Jones (1974), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Gittins-Jones result identifying all optimal strategies for finite-armed bandits may be extended to infinite-armed bandits. We then establish our central result: at each point in time, the arm selected by an optimal strategy will, with strictly positive probability, remain an optimal selection forever. More specifically, for every such arm, there exists (at least) one type of that arm such that, when conditioned on that type being the arm's "true" type, the arm will survive forever and continuously with nonzero probability. When the reward distributions of an arm satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP), the survival prospects of an arm improve when conditioned on types generating higher expected rewards; however, we show how this need not be the case in the absence of MLRP. Implications of these results are derived for the theories of job search and matching, as well as other applications of the bandit paradigm.

AB The paper investigates the existence of stationary sunspot equilibria (SSE) in the vicinity of a steady state in a general, one-step forward looking economic model of dimension n. It is shown that, whenever the steady state is indeterminate, for the associated deterministic dynamics-i.e., there exists a continuum of perfect foresight paths converging to the steady state-then there exists a continuum of SSE of finite order in any neighborhood of the steady state. The proof relies upon bifurcation theory; it provides a characterization of the random processes for which SSE may appear and a description of the location of the support of the SSE close to the bifurcation. The results apply in particular to linear models.

AB This paper develops and analyzes a dynamic stochastic model for a competitive industry which endogenously determines processes for entry and exit and for individual firms' output and employment. The concept of stationary equilibrium is introduced, extending long run industry equilibrium theory to account for entry, exit, and heterogeneity in the size and growth rate of firms. Conditions under which there will be entry and exit in the stationary equilibrium are given. Cross-sectional properties-across size and age cohorts-are analyzed and compared to the data. Implications for the equilibrium distributions of profits and the value of firms are analyzed. The effect of changes in the parameters describing the technological and market conditions of the industry on the equilibrium size distribution and turnover rates are also analyzed.

ID INFORMATION; GAMES
AB We experimentally test some qualitative predictions of the Kreps-Wilson (1982b) model of reputation building in a version of a borrower-lender game first used by Camerer-Weigelt (1988). Our results do not differ substantially from those of Camerer-Weigelt-when we use the same parameters they used. However, we find that the theory fails to account for observed behavioral variations to parameter changes. There is a systematic response to changes in the payoff function of the borrowers, but this response is not in the direction predicted by the theory. This cannot be reconciled with the theory by an appeal to "homemade" priors of the type specified by Camerer-Weigelt. Furthermore, the estimated magnitude of "homemade" priors in the Camerer-Weigelt experiment is inconsistent with estimates derived from behavior observed in our own experiment.

TI ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NASH BARGAINING SOLUTION AND ITS EXTENSION
   TO NONEXPECTED UTILITY PREFERENCES
SO ECONOMETRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE NASH BARGAINING SOLUTION; NONEXPECTED UTILITY; INTERPRETATION
AB The paper reexamines the foundations of the axiomatic Nash bargaining theory. More specifically it questions the interpretation of the Nash bargaining solution and extends it to a family of non-expected utility preferences.
   A bargaining problem is presented as [X, D, greater-than-or-equal-to 1, greater-than-or-equal-to 2] where X is a set of feasible agreements (described in physical terms), D is the disagreement event and greater-than-or-equal-to 1 and greater-than-or-equal-to 2 are preferences defined on the space of lotteries in which the prizes are the elements in X and D. The (ordinal)-Nash bargaining solution is defined as an agreement y* satisfying for all p is-an-element-of [0, 1] and for all x is-an-element-of X: if px >1 y* then py* greater-than-or-equal-to 2 x and if px >2 y* then py* greater-than-or-equal-to 1 x where px is the lottery which gives x with probability p and D with probability 1 - p.
   Revisions of the Pareto, Symmetry, and IIA Axioms characterize the (ordinal)-Nash bargaining solution. In the expected utility case this definition is equivalent to that of the Nash bargaining solution. However, this definition is to be preferred since it allows a statement of the Nash bargaining solution in everyday language and makes possible its natural extension to a wider set of preferences. It also reveals the logic behind some of the more interesting results of the Nash bargaining solution such as the comparative statics of risk aversion and the connection between the Nash bargaining solution and strategic models.

AB In this paper a new estimator is proposed for discrete choice models with choice-based sampling. The estimator is efficient and can incorporate information on the marginal choice probabilities in a straightforward manner and for that case leads to a procedure that is computationally and intuitively more appealing than the estimators that have been proposed before. The idea is to start with a flexible parameterization of the distribution of the explanatory variables and then rewrite the estimator to remove dependence on these parametric assumptions.

AB This paper considers a class of statistics that can be written as the ratio of the sample variance of a filtered time series to the sample variance of the original series. Any such statistic is shown to be optimal under normality for testing a null of white noise against some class of serially dependent alternatives. A simple characterization of the class of alternative models is provided in terms of the filter upon which the statistic is based. These results are applied to demonstrate that a variance ratio test for mean reversion is an optimal test for mean reversion and to illustrate the forms of mean reversion it is best at detecting.

AB It is not unusual for reforming socialist economies to relax wage controls without hardening budget constraints on enterprises or freeing consumer goods prices. This policy can be dangerously destabilizing. While higher wages permit workers to purchase more of some goods, they also tend to exacerbate shortages and to breed waste and corruption. Beyond a certain level, economywide wage hikes will worsen worker welfare. This is true regardless of whether deficit goods are strictly rationed, are sold randomly at official prices to queuing workers, or are offered to workers by "insiders" only at black-market prices. However, the form of allocation does influence the levels of output and welfare.

AB John Harsanyi has provided an intriguing argument that social welfare can be expressed as a weighted sum of individual utilities. His theorem has been criticized on the grounds that a central axiom, that social preference satisfies the independence axiom, has the morally unacceptable implication that the process of choice and considerations of ex ante fairness are of no importance. This paper presents a variation of Harsanyi's theorem in which the axioms are compatible with a concern for ex ante fairness. The implied mathematical form for social welfare is a strictly quasi-concave and quadratic function of individual utilities.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-RUN GROWTH
AB This paper develops a two-sector neoclassical model of international trade with endogenous capital accumulation and intertemporal optimization. In contrast to the traditional "2 x 2 x 2" model, there is a Ricardian implication that countries specialize according to comparative advantage. Consequently, the theory predicts that government expenditure policies are unlikely to affect the established pattern of specialization and trade, but that changes in tax policies can result in a dramatic reorganization of world production. Further, the dynamic 2 x 2 x 2 model can explain many of the salient features of international trade that are problematic for the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model.

AB We ask whether a two-country real business cycle model can account simultaneously for domestic and international aspects of business cycles. With this question in mind, we document a number of discrepancies between theory and data. The most striking discrepancy concerns the correlations of consumption and output across countries. In the data, outputs are generally more highly correlated across countries than consumptions. In the model we see the opposite.

TI INTEREST-RATE CONTROL AND NONCONVERGENCE TO RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM
AB This paper investigates the feasibility of a monetary policy aimed at pegging the nominal rate of interest. It shows that under general conditions such a policy would produce the well-known cumulative process, despite the fact that there exists a well-behaved rational expectations equilibrium with no tendency for inflation to accelerate or decelerate. The cumulative process shows up as the failure of learning to converge to rational expectations. Specifically, the paper shows, first in a conventional IS-LM model with an expectations-augmented Phillips curve and then in a micro-based finance constraint model, that if people follow any learning rule based on experience that satisfies a weak condition, then the sequence of temporary equilibria under a policy of interest pegging cannot converge. The nonconvergent path that will be observed accords with the familiar cumulative process, in that inflation accelerates if the market rate of interest has been pegged below the natural rate.

But in organizations of any significant size, the free-rider effects would seem to choke off any motivational forces. This analysis explores how peer pressure operates and how factors such as profit sharing, shame, guilt, norms, mutual monitoring, and empathy interact to create incentives in the firm. The argument that Japanese firms enjoy team spirit because compensation is linked to overall profitability is analyzed. An explanation for the prevalence of partnerships among individuals in similar occupations is provided.

AB In this paper, we present an overlapping generations model with heterogeneous agents in which human capital investment through formal schooling is the engine of growth. We use simple functional forms for preferences, technologies, and income distribution to highlight the distinction between economies with public education and those with private education. We find that income inequality declines more quickly under public education. On the other hand, private education yields greater per capita incomes unless the initial income inequality is sufficiently high. We also find that societies will choose public education if a majority of agents have incomes below average.

AB It is well known that the inability to observe workers' full labor market productivity can bias estimates of compensating wage differentials. This paper attempts to determine how serious this bias is likely to be. It adopts a stochastic framework of workers' tastes over job attributes and models their equilibrium wage-job attribute choices. Workers' productivity is assumed to consist of observed and unobserved components. Applying the standard estimation methodology, we find that the degree of bias can be surprisingly large. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that contemporary labor market studies are likely to severely underestimate workers' willingness to pay for job attributes. This has implications for a number of applications of compensating wage differentials, including value of life studies.

AB Laboratory data from bargaining experiments have started a debate about the prospects for various parts of game theory as descriptive theories of observable behavior, and about whether, to what extent, and how a successful descriptive theory must take into account peoples' perceptions of "fairness." Plausible explanations of the observed bargaining phenomena advanced by different investigators lead to markedly different predictions about what should be observed in three different games. A sharp experimental test is thus possible on this class of games, and the present paper reports the results of such a test.

TI THE TRANSITION TO A MARKET-ECONOMY - PITFALLS OF PARTIAL REFORM
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a theory of a partial economic reform of a planned economy, similar to the one that took place in Russia since 1988 and in China earlier. In such a reform, some markets are liberalized in the sense that producers can sell output to whomever they want, including private firms, at free prices, but at the same time must sell to state firms at state prices. We show that such a reform can result in a substantial diversion of subsidized inputs away from state firms and toward private firms even when state firms value these inputs more. The result may be a reduction of total output. The simple analysis sheds light on many consequences of the Soviet reform, such as breakdown of coordination of production, increased state policing of delivery quotas, prohibitions of trading cooperatives, and opposition to privatization. The model also explains why partial reform failed in Russia but worked in China.

The "length of the queue" is the key endogenous variable that equilibrates aggregate supply and aggregate demand. Comparative statics analysis shows that an increase in wages over money prices brings about longer queues that reduce labor supply, output, and welfare. When shortages grow beyond a certain critical level, queues fail to sustain aggregate equilibrium in the economy.

AB Access to private information is shown to generate both the incentives and the ability to manipulate asset markets through strategically distorted announcements. The fact that privileged information is noisy interferes with the public's attempts to learn whether such announcements are honest; it allows opportunistic individuals to manipulate prices repeatedly, without ever being fully found out. This leads us to extend Sobel's [1985] model of strategic communication to the case of noisy private signals. Our results show that when truthfulness is not easily verifiable, restrictions on trading by insiders may be needed to preserve the integrity of information embodied in prices.

Expenditures designed to facilitate and inhibit nonexchange transfers, executed privately or through the state, are reported. The numbers indicate that individuals plausibly invested nearly a trillion dollars in transfer activity that year. Nominal GNP in 1985 was just over $4 trillion, which includes numerous transfer-related resource investments that arguably should be subtracted out. Transfer activity thus apparently constitutes a much larger fraction of all economic activity conducted in the United States than previously recognized.

AB Though not conceived as a constant, the natural unemployment rate was taken to be invariant to supply shocks until the late seventies and to real demand shocks until now. The largely micro-theoretic model here is one in a series deriving the natural rate path from general equilibrium. In this model the labor market exhibits generalized real-wage rigidity, resulting from the use of "incentive wages" to combat shirking, and the asset backing shares is the firms' customers, arising from customer-market friction. One finding is that increased consumer demand drives up the natural rate by driving real interest rates up.

In contrast to earlier studies, I find evidence that firms terminate their pension plans to relieve themselves of implicit promises to workers of future compensation. In addition, financing and tax considerations influence the reversion decision. The results suggest that the 1986 excise tax on asset reversions reduced termination for reversion by 36 percent in 1986.

DT Article
ID VARIABLES
AB This paper analyzes empirically for the years 1980-1988 the factors that led states with state income taxes to run tax amnesty programs. We find that the potential yield from an amnesty is more important than the fiscal status of a state. Furthermore, we estimate that if the IRS audit rate had remained constant during the 1980-1988 period (instead of falling by almost one half), then the cumulative probability that an average state would have had a tax amnesty by 1988 would have fallen by just over 25 percent.

ID ECONOMY
AB An economy consisting of identical perfectly competitive firms with real liquidity costs and a one-period production lag has a locally unstable stationary equilibrium with complex eigenvalues for a wide range of parameters. Monetary policy aimed at stabilizing real balances can support nonstationary equilibrium paths that converge to a limit cycle, which has Keynesian features. The First Welfare Theorem does not hold because the price level appears in the production function through liquidity costs, so that production has a positive externality.

AB We propose a family of topologies on the space of consumption patterns in continuous time under uncertainty. Preferences continuous in any of the proposed topologies treat consumptions at nearby dates as almost perfect substitutes except possibly at information surprises. The topological duals of the family of proposed topologies essentially contain processes that are the sums of processes of absolutely continuous paths and martingales. Thus if equilibrium prices for consumption come from the duals, consumptions at nearly adjacent dates in a state of nature have almost equal prices except possibly at information surprises. In particular, if the information structure is generated by a Brownian motion, the duals are composed of Ito processes. We investigate some implications of our topologies on standard models of choice in continuous time as well as on recent models of non-time-separable representations of preferences. We also discuss the properties of prices of long-lived assets in economies populated with agents whose preferences are continuous in our topologies when there are no arbitrage opportunities.

DE GAME THEORY; EXPERIMENTS; RATIONALITY; ALTRUISM
ID INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; EQUILIBRIUM; REPUTATION
AB We report on an experiment in which individuals play a version of the centipede game. In this game, two players alternately get a chance to take the larger portion of a continually escalating pile of money. As soon as one person takes, the game ends with that player getting the larger portion of the pile, and the other player getting the smaller portion. If one views the experiment as a complete information game, all standard game theoretic equilibrium concepts predict the first mover should take the large pile on the first round. The experimental results show that this does not occur.
   An alternative explanation for the data can be given if we reconsider the game as a game of incomplete information in which there is some uncertainty over the payoff functions of the players. In particular, if the subjects believe there is some small likelihood that the opponent is an altruist, then in the equilibrium of this incomplete information game, players adopt mixed strategies in the early rounds of the experiment, with the probability of taking increasing as the pile gets larger. We investigate how well a version of this model explains the data observed in the centipede experiments.

AB This paper supposes an individual cares about his/her own wealth not only directly but also via the relative standing that this wealth induces. The implications for risk-taking are investigated in particular. Such a model provides a natural explanation of the "concave-convex-concave" utility described by Friedman and Savage. However, there are a number of key differences between the present model and any model based on own wealth alone. For example, an equilibrium wealth distribution here may have a middle class. Further, the status interaction involves an externality and an equilibrium wealth distribution may be Pareto inefficient.

AB While there are now many results on the existence of marginal cost pricing equilibrium, we argue that they are unsatisfactory in one important respect. They typically make a survival assumption which is stated as a condition on the production equilibria of the economy. The primary objective of this paper is to provide an existence result which replaces such an assumption with one on the primitive data of the economy. Our main assumption is that no firm faces unbounded increasing returns in the sense that if it uses some input then the rate at which this input can be substituted into an output is finite. The proof is relatively elementary and allows for a straightforward extension to the case of more general pricing rules.

We show that it is possible to act rationally provided we limit our attention to a natural subset of solvable games and to opponents who use rational algorithms; the outcome is a Nash equilibrium. Going further we show that rationality is possible on many domains of games and opposing algorithms but each domain requires a particular solution algorithm; no one algorithm is rational on all possible domains.

The empirical methodology uses the entry decisions of airlines as indicators of underlying profitability; the results extend the empirical literature on airport presence by providing a new set of estimates of the determinants of city pair profitability. The literature on empirical models of oligopoly entry is also extended, particularly via a focus on the important (and difficult) role of differences between firms.

AB An elicitation diagnostic forms a question that compares the information in the prior distribution with the information in the given sample. One elicitation diagnostic identifies a family of prior distributions that are so diffuse that they are practically equivalent to the "completely" diffuse prior. Another elicitation diagnostic identifies a family of prior distributions that concentrate enough mass in the neighborhood of zero that they are practically equivalent to the dogmatic prior which sets a parameter exactly equal to zero. The question that is asked is whether the subject's prior distribution falls in either of these two classes. If an affirmative answer, can be given to either of these two elicitation questions then there is no need to go to the expense of a more accurate elicitation of the prior distribution.

AB This paper is a study of the dynamics of the efficient distribution of consumption in an exchange economy with many consumers, each of whom is subject to private, idiosyncratic taste shocks. We propose a recursive method for finding feasible allocations that are incentive-compatible and that are Pareto optimal within this set. The method is applied to several parametric examples. We find that in an efficient allocation the degree of inequality continually increases, with a diminishing fraction of the population receiving an increasing fraction of the resources. We discuss the extent to which these allocations can be decentralized via market arrangements.

ID INFORMATION; CONTRACTS
AB This paper motivates a financial propagation mechanism in the context of an intertemporal production economy with asymmetric information, and with borrowers and lenders who enter multi-period financial relationships. A key feature is that aggregate output and borrowers' "financial capacity"-the maximum overhang of past debt they may feasibly carry-are determined jointly, much in the spirit of Gurley and Shaw (1955). Expectations of future economic conditions govern financial capacity which in turn may constrain current production, especially in bad times. A small but persistent shift in aggregate conditions may have a large impact on financial capacity, making the framework capable of motivating large endogenous fluctuations in financial constraints.

AB We analyze incomplete long-term financial contracts between an entrepreneur with no initial wealth and a wealthy investor. Both agents have potentially conflicting objectives since the entrepreneur cares about both pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns from the project while the investor is only concerned about monetary returns. We address the questions of (i) whether and how the initial contract can be structured in such a way as to bring about a perfect coincidence of objectives between both agents (ii) when the initial contract cannot achieve this coincidence of objectives how should control rights be allocated to achieve efficiency? One of the main results of our analysis concerns the optimality properties of the (contingent) control allocation induced by standard debt financing.

The answer is relevant to problems in both game theory and econometrics, as we illustrate with examples. Our purpose here is to bring the powerful tools of the theory of analytic sets as developed by Dellacherie and Meyer (1978) to the wider attention of the economics profession and to distill Dellacherie and Meyer's work in such a way as to provide some readily accessible theoretical results that will permit relatively easy treatment of economically or econometrically relevant applications.

ID LABOR MOBILITY; SELF-SELECTION; MARKET; MODEL
AB This paper provides empirical assessments of the two leading explanations of measured inter-industry wage differentials: (1) true wage differentials exist across industries, and (2) the measured differentials simply reflect unmeasured differences in workers' productive abilities. First, we summarize the existing evidence on the unmeasured-ability explanation. Second, we construct a simple model which shows that if matching is important then endogenous job-change decisions can create important self-selection biases even in first-differenced estimates of industry wage differentials. Third, we analyze a sample that approximates the experiment of exogenous job loss. We find that (i) the wage change experienced by a typical industry switcher closely resembles the difference in the relevant industry differentials estimated in a cross-section, and (ii) pre-displacement industry affiliation plays an important role in post-displacement wage determination.

We provide statistical evidence on the compatibility of the two samples for the purposes of estimating our model. We find that search has a direct negative effect on hours of work and we establish a strong positive effect of wages on hours.

AB This paper studies reputation effects in games with a single long-run player whose choice of stage-game strategy is imperfectly observed by his opponents. We obtain lower and upper bounds on the long-run player's payoff in any Nash equilibrium of the game. If the long-run player's stage-game strategy is statistically identified by the observed outcomes, then for generic payoffs the upper and lower bounds both converge, as the discount factor tends to 1, to the long-run player's Stackelberg payoff, which is the most he could obtain by publicly committing himself to any strategy.

ID INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY
AB We consider a principal-agent contracting problem under incomplete information where some of the agent's actions are imperfectly observable. Contracts take the form of reward schedules based on the noisy observation of the agent's action. We first review situations where the principal can reach the same utility as in the absence of noise. Then we focus on the use of linear reward schedules, which allow universal implementation, i.e. implementation of a given mechanism for any unbiased noise of observation, and on quadratic reward schedules, which only require the knowledge of the variance of the noise. We exhibit sufficient conditions under which linear reward schedules implement a given mechanism. Finally, we characterize necessary conditions for a mechanism to be implementable under noisy observation by a linear schedule, and by quadratic schedules. We give the geometric intuition behind all results.

TI COMPETITIVE SELECTION AND MARKET DATA - THE MIXED-INDEX PROBLEM
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRICES
AB If prices have an allocational role, then in addition to their economic signalling, they may act as a statistical signal for the existence of selection bias in cross-sectional studies with some form of price (wages, rental, yield etc.) as dependent variable. Elements of competitive selection appear in the pricing theory of real or financial assets and in the determination of wage rates, where prices correlate the characteristics of the asset or job with those of the individuals, under the equilibrium allocation. If prices achieve such an allocation, then regressions with price as dependent variable are prima facie "mixed-index" in character, with adverse bias or consistency properties, no matter that the right-hand regressors are apparently exogenous. We set up a paradigm for competitive selection and use the concepts so generated to codify the conditions under which mixed index bias will occur. The problem may be regarded as one of selection bias, but does not necessarily derive from classical simultaneity, and is a problem of data-generation structures rather than sample selection.

AB When economic theory suggests a log-linear specification for individual agents, e.g., Cobb-Douglas production, it is common to estimate the same log-linear model with aggregate data, invoking a representative agent assumption and thereby assuming away aggregation errors. This paper gives necessary and sufficient restrictions on the distribution of agents in an economy for log-linear agent models to aggregate into log-linear macro models, and discusses the aggregation bias resulting from violation of these restrictions. Theorems, tests, economic rationales, and empirical results are given. Included are connections to random walks and to cointegration. Analogous results for log-level models are derived.

AB During the 1980's, a period in which the average level of real wage rates was roughly stagnant, there were large changes in the structure of relative wages, most notably a huge increase in the relative wages of highly educated workers. This paper attempts to assess the power of several alternative explanations of the observed relative wage changes in the context of a theoretical framework that nests all of these explanations. Our conclusion is that their major cause was a shift in the skill structure of labor demand brought about by biased technological change.

ID EARNINGS; INEQUALITY; FAMILY; ERROR; MALES
AB Social scientists and policy analysts have long expressed concern about the extent of intergenerational income mobility in the United States, but remarkably little empirical evidence is available. The few existing estimates of the intergenerational correlation in income have been biased downward by measurement error, unrepresentative samples, or both. New estimates based on intergenerational data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics imply that the intergenerational correlation in long-run income is at least 0.4, indicating dramatically less mobility than suggested by earlier research.

AB This paper provides estimates of the correlation in lifetime earnings between fathers and sons. Intergenerational data from the National Longitudinal Survey are used. Earlier studies, conducted for the United States, report elasticities of children's earnings with respect to parent's earnings of 0.2 or less, suggesting extensive integenerational mobility. These estimates, however, are biased downward by error-contaminated measures of lifetime economic status. Estimates presented in this paper correct for the problem of measurement error and find the intergenerational correlation in income to be on the order of 0.4. This suggests considerably less intergenerational mobility than previously believed.

AB Hours worked and the return to working are weakly correlated. Traditionally, the ability to account for this fact has been a litmus test for macroeconomic models. Existing real-business-cycle models fail this test dramatically. We modify prototypical real-business-cycle models by allowing government consumption shocks to influence labor-market dynamics. This modification can, in principle, bring the models into closer conformity with the data. Our empirical results indicate that it does.

We show that the conditions that guarantee interior Walrasian equilibria in conjunction with a continuity restriction on strategies rule out equilibria with extremely low levels of activity (zero activity), which is a distinguishing feature of many existing models. We study the case of separability and show that there is no rationing and, hence, no equilibrium  unemployment. In addition, in a numerical example, we find that there is a unique symmetric equilibrium.

AB Including data from the 1980's sharply weakens the postwar time-series evidence indicating significant relationships between money (however defined) and nominal income or between money and either real income or prices separately. Focusing on data from 1970 onward destroys this evidence altogether. Evidence indicating cointegration of real income and real money balances, with due allowance for the effect of interest rates, also deteriorates when the sample extends through the 1980's. A positive finding is that the spread between the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate consistently contains highly significant information about future movements in real income.

The model assumes costly matching in the labor market and a thin-market externality in the output market that makes the profitability of hiring depend positively on the number of firms hiring. The equilibrium does not rely on any effect of expected inflation on labor supply. It is also stable under learning, Bayesian updating induces convergence to the equilibrium with positive probability even if people start with no definite belief that animal spirits affect the profitability of hiring.

AB Recent contributions emphasize that the presence of exchange-rate target zones has important effects on the within-band behavior of exchange rates when agents are forward-looking. We find that the implications of available models are inconsistent with European exchange-rate data, and we suggest that the frequent realignments occurring in the period we consider may be responsible for this. We construct a model in which the likelihood of a realignment in the near future increases as the exchange rate approaches the limits of its fluctuation band and show that its implications are broadly consistent with the evidence.

ID REGRESSIONS
AB The importance of seigniorage relative to other sources of government revenue differs markedly across countries. This paper tries to explain this regularity by studying a political model of tax reform. The model implies that countries with a more unstable and polarized political system will have more inefficient tax structures and, thus, will rely more heavily on seigniorage. This prediction of the model is tested on cross-sectional data for 79 countries. We find that, after controlling for other variables, political instability is positively associated with seigniorage.

If some degrees of the offense are not adequately reported or if investigation is too costly, the regulator must monitor and treat offenses of different severity quite differently. Smaller offenses should not be investigated; they should be deterred by monitoring alone, coupled with graduated fines. To deter larger offenses, the regulator should vary the investigation rate while setting maximal fines.

Later, we show that the principal finds it profitable to organize competition between several agents, even though he has monopoly power and can push a single agent down to his reservation utility.

This paper explicitly adds a time dimension to an implementation problem and introduces a natural criterion of renegotiation-proofness for the case of time-consuming renegotiation. The main insight gained is that the addition of the time dimension enlarges significantly the set of contracts that can be implemented in a renegotiation-proof manner.

AB The paper develops a general, "collective" model of household labor supply in which agents are characterized by their own (possibly altruistic) preferences, and household decisions are only assumed to be Pareto efficient. An alternative interpretation is that there are two stages in the internal decision process: agents first share nonlabor income, according to some given sharing rule; then each one optimally chooses his or her own labor supply and consumption. This setting is shown to generate testable restrictions on labor supplies. Moreover, the observation of labor supply behavior is sufficient for recovering individual preferences and the sharing rule (up to a constant). Finally, the traditional tools of welfare analysis can be adapted to the new setting.

We show that the optimal compensation contract optimizes total incentives:  the combination of the implicit incentives from career concerns and the explicit incentives from the compensation contract.  Thus the explicit incentives from the optimal compensation contract should be strongest for workers close to retirement because career concerns are weakest for these workers.

While such evidence is suggestive, it is often open to other interpretations.  We examine these models using data on equipment investment in the U.S. agricultural sector.  This sector is particularly interesting because it has experienced large fluctuations in net worth and the profitability of investment, and reasonable measures of net worth can be constructed.  Our findings provide support for a class of "internal funds" models of investment under asymmetric information.

A constrained optimization model of labor force dynamics is implemented empirically integrating features of models previously described in the literature. The estimates of the model provide quantitative evidence on underlying structural differences in labor market constraints faced by blacks and whites. For example, while blacks have overall a substantially smaller wage return to work experience and face a less disperse wage offer distribution, blacks face a higher probability of receiving job offers.

For a finite population, in addition to the standard underprovision type of results, inefficiency occurs because of a delay in contributions.  For an infinite population, although delay may disappear, underprovision remains so that equilibrium is still inefficient.  Policy implications of these results are described, emphasis being put on possible government intervention with incomplete information.

TI INCENTIVE CONTRACTS AND PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; COSTS; PAY
AB This paper examines the characteristics of incentive contracts in which the agent's payoff is not based on the principal's objective. I show that contracts based on such performance measures will not in general provide first-best incentives, even when the agent is risk neutral. The form of the optimal contract and the efficiency of this contract depend on the relationship between the performance measure used and the principal's objective. The model provides a simple and intuitive statistical measure that serves as a metric for the efficiency of a performance measure. Applications to various incentive contracting situations, including the "gaming" of performance measures, the use of revenue-based sales commissions, and relative performance evaluation, are presented.

AB We study the monetary theory implications of fixed costs associated with trade in private assets. We show that with heterogeneous endowment profiles it is possible for an endogenous subset of agents to hold currency even when it is dominated in return by a competing asset. With respect to positive issues in monetary theory, the model implies that changes in the steady-state growth rate of the money supply have a negative effect on real interest rates because of endogenous market participation measures. On the normative side, we show that there may be an equity-efficiency trade-off from monetary deflation.

TI ARE CONTRIBUTORS RATIONAL - UNTANGLING STRATEGIES OF POLITICAL-ACTION

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
ID CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS; MODEL
AB Empirical public choice literature and casual observation suggest that the behavior of political action committees is remarkably unsophisticated, meaning that PACs give to those legislators who would support their interests anyway. Thus it is suggested that contributor behavior deviates from rational behavior, which is a cornerstone of economic analysis. In this paper, a switching regression model is estimated that allows for strategies of PACs to vary for different contribution recipients. I analyze the behavior of farm PACs over three election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, I find that contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior. Contributors who attempt to influence the voting behavior of members of Congress give the most money to legislators whose constituency interest suggests that they are likely to be undecided on how to vote and PACs give less money to legislators who represent districts with larger farm populations because those legislators are likely to vote in contributor interests anyway.

AB Manski (1985) has shown that the maximum score estimator of the coefficient vector of a binary response model is consistent under weak distributional assumptions. Cavanagh (1987) and Kim and Pollard (1989) have shown that N1/3 times the centered maximum score estimator converges in distribution to the random variable that maximizes a certain Gaussian process. The properties of the limiting distribution are largely unknown, and the result of Cavanagh and Kim and Pollard cannot be used for inference in applications. This paper describes a modified maximum score estimator that is obtained by maximizing a smoothed version of Manski's score function. Under distributional assumptions that are somewhat stronger than Manski's but still very weak, the centered smoothed estimator is asymptotically normal with a convergence rate that is at least N-2/5 and can be made arbitrarily close to N-1/2, depending on the strength of certain smoothness assumptions. The estimator's rate of convergence is the fastest possible under the assumptions that are made. The parameters of the limiting distribution can be estimated consistently from data, thereby making statistical inference based on the smoothed estimator possible with samples that are sufficiently large.

DE PANEL DATA; FIXED EFFECTS; TRUNCATED AND CENSORED REGRESSION
AB This paper considers estimation of truncated and censored regression models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations (LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead, the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.

ID CONDITIONAL MOMENT RESTRICTIONS; ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY; NONPARAMETRIC
   MODELS; GENERALIZED-METHOD; INFORMATION; ESTIMATORS
AB The paper derives efficiency bounds for conditional moment restrictions with a nonparametric component. The data form a random sample from a distribution F. There is a given function of the data and a parameter. The restriction is that a conditional expectation of this function is zero at some point in the parameter space. The parameter has two parts: a finite-dimensional component theta and a general function h, which is evaluated at a subset of the conditioning variables. An example is a regression function that is additive in parametric and nonparametric components, as arises in sample selection models.
   If F is assumed to be multinomial with known (finite) Support, then the problem becomes parametric, with the values of h at the mass points forming part of the parameter vector. Then an efficiency bound for theta and for linear functionals of h can be obtained from the Fisher information matrix, as in Chamberlain (1987). The bound depends only upon certain conditional moments and not upon the support of the distribution. A general F satisfying the restrictions can bc approximated by a multinomial distribution satisfying the restrictions, and so the explicit form of the multinomial bound applies in general.
   The efficiency bound for theta is extended to a more general model in which different components of h may depend on different known functions of the variables. Although an explicit form for the bound is no longer available, a variational characterization of the bound is provided.
   The efficiency bound is applied to a random coefficients model for panel data, in which the conditional expectation of the random coefficients given covariates plays the role of the function h. An instrumental-variables estimator is set up within a finite-dimensional, method-of-moments framework. The bound provides guidance on the choice of instrumental variables.

AB This paper analyzes a class of alternating-offer bargaining games with one-sided incomplete information for the case of "no gap." If sequential equilibria are required to satisfy the additional restrictions of stationarity, monotonicity, pure strategies, and no free screening, we establish the Silence Theorem: When the time interval between successive periods is made sufficiently short, the informed party never makes any serious offers in the play of alternating-offer bargaining games. A class of parametric examples suggests that the time interval required to assure silence is not especially brief.
   As a byproduct of the analysis, we also prove (under the same set of assumptions) a uniform version of the Coase Conjecture: When the time interval between successive periods is made sufficiently short, the initial serious offer by either party in an alternating-offer bargaining game must be less than epsilon times the highest possible buyer valuation, for an entire family of distribution functions.

DE BACKWARD INDUCTION; SEQUENTIAL RATIONALITY; NORMAL FORM PERFECTION
ID RATIONALIZABLE STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR; GAMES
AB A weakening of Kreps and Wilson's (1982) notion of sequential rationality for extensive form games is presented. The motivation behind this weakening stems from the difficulty in justifying sequentially rational behavior in subgames reachable only through a violation of sequential rationality. Although the notion of weak sequential rationality developed here is based upon extensive form considerations, it bears a close relation to Selten's (1975) normal form perfect equilibria. Also, a class of restrictions one might impose upon out of equilibrium beliefs is suggested. The weakest of these results from the assumption that deviators are expected utility maximizers. The strongest yields backward induction outcomes in generic games with perfect information. Lastly, it is argued, with the aid of an example having imperfect information, that sequential rationality is not the consequence of equilibrium play and the absence of incredible threats.

We show prices (and profits) are higher than without switching costs, and that this result does not depend importantly on our specific assumptions. We show switching costs make the market more attractive to a new entrant, even though an entrant must overcome the disadvantage that a large fraction of the market is already committed to the incumbent's product. We also examine the effects of market growth.

AB Predictions of the noisy rational expectations equilibrium (REE) model are found to be relatively accurate for both asset and information markets in the laboratory. When information about an asset's uncertain dividend is sold to a fixed number of highest bidders, prices, allocations, efficiency, and distribution of profit predictions of the full revelation REE model in the asset market dominate the predictions of the Walrasian model; demand for information shifts to the left and its price declines close to zero. When the price of information is fixed at a relatively high level, the number of informed agents and the informativeness of the asset market tends to adjust to permit the informed agents to recover their investment in information.

AB Voters penalize federal and state spending growth. This is the central result of my analysis of voting behavior in Presidential, Senatorial, and gubernatorial elections from 1950-1988. The composition of federal spending growth seems irrelevant. The vote loss to the President's party from an extra dollar of defense or nondefense spending is the same. However, in gubernatorial elections, expansion of state welfare spending exacts a disproportionate political price. Deficit financing of federal or state spending does not appear to matter politically. I conclude by discussing the obvious question of why government budgets have grown in the face of this voter hostility.

AB An oft-repeated goal in many contexts is the "preservation of diversity." But what is the diversity function to be optimized? This paper shows how a reasonable measure of the "value of diversity" of a collection of objects can be recursively generated from more fundamental information about the dissimilarity-distance between any pair of objects in the set. The diversity function is shown to satisfy a basic dynamic programming equation, which in a well-defined sense generates an optimal classification scheme. A surprisingly rich theory of diversity emerges, having ramifications for several disciplines. Implications and applications are discussed.

AB This paper examines whether the Solow growth model is consistent with the international variation in the standard of living. It shows that an augmented Solow model that includes accumulation of human as well as physical capital provides an excellent description of the cross-country data. The paper also examines the implications of the Solow model for convergence in standards of living, that is, for whether poor countries tend to grow faster than rich countries. The evidence indicates that, holding population growth and capital accumulation constant, countries converge at about the rate the augmented Solow model predicts.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID EARNINGS; SENIORITY; DURATION
AB Using longitudinal data, we study the processes of job mobility and wage growth among young men. During the first ten years in the labor market, a typical worker will hold seven jobs, about two thirds of his career total. The evolution of wages plays a key role in this transition to stable employment: wage gains at job changes account for at least a third of early-career wage growth, and the wage is the key determinant of job changing decisions among young workers. Job changing is a critical component of workers' movement toward the stable employment relations of mature careers.
   The wastefulness of this "try and try again" process of advancing to a better position is self-evident. The worker does not know in detail the nature of the job which he is obtaining nor does he know his own capacities. Nevertheless it is the principal method by which workers at the present time improve their condition on their own initiative [Slichter, 1919, p. 218].

ID PRODUCTION-SMOOTHING MODEL; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper argues that the macroeconomically interesting features of inventory behavior are well captured by a model in which firms face only demand uncertainty with a nonnegativity constraint on inventories. Empirical implications of the "stockout-avoidance" model of inventory behavior are derived and then tested on disaggregated automobile industry data. The results largely support the model, though they suggest a small role for production-smoothing as well. Subsidiary evidence on the relative variance of demand and cost shocks suggests that demand shocks are indeed more important.

More precisely, we find that equal opportunity laws and affirmative action programs always benefit disadvantaged groups. Equal opportunity laws also increase the effort levels of all subjects and hence the profits of the tournament administrator (usually the firm). The effects of affirmative action programs depend on the severity of a group's cost disadvantage. When the cost disadvantage is severe, these programs significantly increase effort levels (and hence profits). The opposite is true when the disadvantage is slight.

Evidence is provided by a new data set describing 871 California propositions. The main findings are the following. "Good government" issues were usually resolved by legislative measures and distributional issues by initiatives. Citizen-initiated legislation was more common when representatives were unresponsive to the electorate. Voter turnout was higher on distributional propositions than good government propositions. Voter participation on ballot measures has been increasing over time.

AB Research on decision making under uncertainty has been strongly influenced by the documentation of numerous expected utility (EU) anomalies-behaviors that violate the expected utility axioms. The relative lack of progress on the closely related topic of intertemporal choice is partly due to the absence of an analogous set of discounted utility (DU) anomalies. We enumerate a set of DU anomalies analogous to the EU anomalies and propose a model that accounts for the anomalies, as well as other intertemporal choice phenomena incompatible with DU. We discuss implications for savings behavior, estimation of discount rates, and choice framing effects.

AB Recent theory casts doubt on the frequently used interindustry regression method of inferring a country's abundant factors. This paper examines the empirical importance of these theoretical qualifications by comparing regression-derived estimates of factor abundance with both revealed and actual factor abundances for 35 countries and 12 resources. We demonstrate the theoretical importance of trade imbalances for the reliability of the regression estimates and therefore propose and implement a theoretically consistent trade imbalance correction. The results indicate that, despite valid theoretical concerns, the regression estimates are generally reliable indicators of revealed factor abundance. Therefore, the innumerable regression studies conducted over the past 30 years can be considered to provide reliable evidence concerning the validity of the factor abundance theory.

AB We show that there is a strong, positive correlation across countries and industries between the standard deviation of the seasonal component and the standard deviation of the nonseasonal component of aggregate variables. After documenting this stylized fact, we discuss possible explanations and develop a model that generates our empirical finding. The main feature of the model is that firms endogenously choose their degree of technological flexibility as a function of the amounts of seasonal and nonseasonal variation in demand. Although this model is intended to be illustrative, we find evidence supporting one of its key empirical implications.

ID MARGINS; MODEL
AB Panel data on consumer bank deposit interest rates reveal asymmetric impacts of market concentration on the dynamic adjustment of prices to shocks. Banks in concentrated markets are slower to raise interest rates on deposits in response to rising market interest rates, but are faster to reduce them in response to declining market interest rates. Thus, banks with market power skim off surplus on movements in both directions. Since deposit interest rates are inversely related to the price charged by banks for deposits, the results suggest that downward price rigidity and upward price flexibility are a consequence of market concentration.

ID PROCUREMENT
AB We analyze split award procurement auctions in which a buyer divides full production between two suppliers or awards all production to a single supplier, and suppliers have private cost information. An intriguing feature of split awards is that the equilibrium bids are implicitly coordinated. Because a split award price is the sum of offered split prices, each supplier can unilaterally veto a split award by bidding very high for the split. The need to coordinate is reflected in a split price that does not vary with private information. We also explore conditions under which split award auctions may be preferred to winner-take-all auctions.

AB Postwar U.S. time series for money, interest rates, prices, and GNP are characterized by a multivariate process driven by four exogenous disturbances. Those disturbances are identified so that they can be interpreted as the four main sources of fluctuations found in the IS-LM-Phillips curve model: money supply, money demand, IS, and aggregate supply shocks. The dynamic properties of the estimated model are analyzed and shown to match most of the stylized predictions of the model. The estimated decomposition is also used to measure the relative importance of each shock, to interpret some macroeconomic episodes, and to study sources of permanent shocks to nominal variables.

AB We present experimental evidence on nonbinding, preplay communication in bilateral coordination games. To evaluate the effect of "cheap talk," we consider two communication structures (one-way and two-way communication) and two types of coordination games (one with a cooperative strategy and a second in which one strategy is less "risky"). In games with a cooperative strategy, one-way communication increases play of the Pareto-dominant equilibrium relative to the no communication baseline; two-way communication does not always decrease the frequency of coordination failures. In the second type of game, two-way communication always leads to the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium, while one-way communication does not.

ID GROWTH
AB A key economic issue is whether poor countries or regions tend to grow faster than rich ones:  are there automatic forces that lead to convergence over time in the levels of per capita income and product?  We use the neoclassical growth model as a framework to study convergence across the 48 contiguous U.S. states.  We exploit data on personal income since 1840 and on gross state product since 1963.  The U.S. states provide clear evidence of convergence, but the findings can be reconciled quantitatively with the neoclassical model only if diminishing returns to capital set in very slowly.  The results for per capita gross domestic product from a broad sample of countries are similar if we hold constant a set of variables that proxy for differences in steady-state characteristics.

AB While the consequences of nominal wage contracts have been rather thoroughly analyzed, there is no generally accepted theory of why such contracts prevail.  In this paper I argue that the distinction between insiders and outsiders is important for understanding nominal wage contracts.  Since most employment fluctuations take the form of fluctuations in hiring, insiders are normally not affected by them.  Since prices are primarily determined by costs, demand shocks have small effects on real wages.  Thus insiders have little incentive to change to more complicated contracts.  With rigid nominal wages, nominal demand shocks have large effects on the employment opportunities of outsiders, but outsiders have little influence on labor contracts.

The analysis demonstrates that efficient religions with perfectly rational members may benefit from stigma, self-sacrifice, and bizarre behavioral restrictions.  The model also addresses sacrifice in nonreligious "social clubs":  fraternities, communes, political parties, work groups, and families.

TI HISTORY ROLE IN COORDINATING DECENTRALIZED ALLOCATION DECISIONS

AB What causes individual suppliers to allocate goods in such a way that the aggregate allocation satisfies the law of one price?  A satisfactory answer to this question must confront two related problems:  Equal net prices at all allocations provide no information to suppliers about the quantity to deliver to a specific location, and strategic uncertainty makes an observed violation of the law of one price an unreliable indicator of a profit opportunity.  This paper develops a simple analytical framework to formalize these two problems, reviews some solutions found in the literature, and reports laboratory evidence on how people solve them.  In addressing these issues, we focus on the role historical prices play in coordinating decentralized allocation decisions.

Empirical results strongly support the noisy rational expectations hypothesis.  This indicates that a significant amount of noise exists (so that private information has value), but not enough to obfuscate entirely the information content of price.  Our analysis also indicates that the dispersion of private information across traders has an impact on trading volume, but not on price.

ID VARIABILITY; ADJUSTMENT; MONEY; REGRESSORS; MODELS; COSTS
AB This paper analyzes the effects of inflation on the dispersion of prices, as well as other aspects of price behavior, using disaggregated data on prices of foodstuffs in Israel during 1978-84.  We find that the effect of expected inflation on intramarket price variability is stronger than the effect of unexpected inflation.  We show that even in times of high inflation, price quotations are not trivially short and price changes are not synchronized across firms.  These facts, taken together, confirm that there is some staggering in the setting of prices.  We find that the distribution of real prices is far from being uniform, as many menu cost-based models assume or conclude.  In fact, as inflation increases to very high levels, this distribution is not even symmetric.  When the annual inflation rate reaches 130 percent, there are equal chances of finding real prices above or below the market average, but upward deviations in the real price are further away from zero than downward ones.  Furthermore, as the annual rate of inflation more than doubles from 60 to 130 percent, real prices are pushed toward both tails of the distribution.

AB We describe a model in which rental and owner housing are risky assets, tenure choice is endogenous, and each household is constrained to consume the same amount of owner housing that it has in its investment portfolio.  At each iteration in the search for an equilibrium, we determine the new taxable income for each of 3,578 households (from the Survey of Consumer Finances), and we use statutory schedules to find the marginal rate and tax paid.  Equilibrium net rates of return are major determinants of the amount of owner housing, but a logit model indicates that demographic factors are the main determinants of ownership rates.  In our simulation, taxes on owner housing would raise welfare not only by reallocating capital but also by the government's taking part of the risk from individual properties and diversifying it away.  Measures to disallow property tax or mortgage interest deductions do not help share this risk.  Simulations of the 1986 tax reform indicate a small shift from rental to owner housing and welfare gains from reallocating risk.

Equilibrium exists under standard conditions.  It is shown that, under certain conditions, a stable set exists and is contained in a connected set of equilibria.  For generic models there exists a stable outcome, that is, all the equilibria in the stable set have the same outcome.  These ideas are applied to markets with one-sided and two-sided uncertainty.  Under standard monotonicity conditions, it is shown that the stable outcome is separating and implies a particular pattern of matches of buyers and sellers.

AB This paper uses a unique data set to determine which dynamic model of tacit collusion best describes behaviour in a particular industry.  The area investigated is a region of the Vancouver, British Columbia retail-gasoline market.  Players are service-station managers who compete daily.  Firms choose price in each period using strategies that depend on prices chosen in the previous period.  Periodically, unanticipated demand shocks precipitate price wars.  When shocks occur, the firms in the market must determine the new demand conditions and adjust their strategies.  From an economic point of view, slopes of intertemporal reaction functions are latent variables.  The resulting system of equations with time-varying parameters is estimated via the Kalman filter.  Different repeated-game oligopoly models correspond to different transition matrices for the latent variables.  The models can thus be assessed in terms of their power to explain firm behaviour in this market.

AB This paper examines how inflation affects efficiency and output in monopolistically competitive search markets.  It formalizes the conventional wisdom linking higher inflation, price dispersion, and increased resources devoted to search.  It also brings to light the induced exit of firms, which reduces rent dissipation.  But the most important effect of inflation is how it alters the distribution of real transactions prices.  Whether this reduces or promotes efficiency and output is shown to depend critically on preferences and market structure, and especially on whether search costs are large or small relative to consumer surplus.

ID INVENTORY
AB This paper analyses the optimum pricing policies of a multiproduct monopoly in the presence of inflation and fixed costs of nominal price changes.  We examine the conditions which lead to staggered or synchronized pricing policies when the timing of price changes is endogenous.  Two aspects of the decision problem are emphasized:  the interactions in the joint profit function between the prices of the various goods and the interactions in the costs of price adjustment.  We show that with positive interactions in the profit function and costs of price adjustments that are independent across products, staggering is unlikely.  Depending on initial conditions, a firm may follow a staggered steady state or a synchronized steady state path.  But the former is locally unstable while the latter is attained from a broad set of initial conditions.  For a small rate of interest the staggered policy is optimal iff the interaction in profits is negative.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB This paper presents a general model of the demand for differentiated products which has as special cases two popular models used to analyse welfare and competition in monopolistically competitive markets:  the model of spatial competition and the symmetric aggregate benefit function approach.
   Our model is especially attractive because it starts from economic primitives:  a specification of the set of possible individual preference patterns.  It shows how specific properties of the distribution of preferences translate into properties of aggregate demand.  This allows us to understand the relationship between the distribution of preferences and the degree to which the market introduces biases in product selection.

ID CURRENT ACCOUNT
AB Despite the significance of limited labour mobility across sectors, few attempts have been made to produce dynamic models of sectoral adjustment which are consistent with perfect foresight and, yet, flexible enough to allow for a variety of dynamic experiments.  This paper proposes a simple perfect-foresight model of two-sector economies, in which aggregate sectoral movement of labour takes place through the process of demographic change.  The model is tractable enough that one can easily examine the effects of intertemporally complicated relative price shocks (both exogenous and endogenous) under a variety of assumptions on technology.

The incumbents engage in a non-cooperative game against each other and act as Stackelberg leaders with respect to a vote-maximizing entrant.  We prove that the equilibrium of this game, called a hierarchical equilibrium, exists and is unique for an arbitrary single-peaked distribution of voters' ideal points.  Moreover, we fully characterize the set of equilibrium strategies and show its equivalence to the set of strategies generated by a perfect-foresight equilibrium.

The relationship between these measures of transitory income and savings indicates that farm households save a significantly higher fraction of transitory income than nontransitory income.

AB This paper employs province-level panel data to assess the contributions of decollectivization, price adjustments, and other reforms to China's agricultural growth in the reform period.  Decollectivization is found to improve total factor productivity and to account for about half of the output growth during 1978-1984.  The adjustment in state procurement prices also contributed positively to output growth.  Its impact came mainly from the responses in input use.  The effect of other market-related reforms on productivity and output growth was very small.  Reasons for slowdown in agricultural growth after 1984 are also analyzed.

AB I study how landownership affects labor allocation, income distribution, and poverty in less developed countries. I focus on three prototypes of ownership classes: landlords, smallholders, and landless people. Agents are identical except for their ownership of assets. On the basis of optimizing behavior, they divide into urban workers in the modern sector, urban workers in the informal sector, agricultural laborers, subsistence farmers, and landlords. The impact of land reform on production and poverty depends on the amount of fertile land per capita. A more egalitarian distribution of landownership reduces poverty where land is scarce but not where land is abundant.

AB When exporting firms face the prospect of voluntary export restraints (VER's), they have an incentive to export more than with no prospect of a VER, since greater exports lead to larger license allocations in the event of a VER.  Export-country governments' incentives differ, leading either to export tax or subsidy, depending on the circumstances.  The prospect of one departure from free trade thus leads to another, a domino effect.  Anti-dumping enforcement will ordinarily not eliminate and ironically may increase dumping, toppling another domino.

AB I consider a model in which one firm in each of two countries produces a homogeneous good and sells it exclusively to a third country.  Each firm simultaneously selects a supply function before a demand shock occurs.  The model assumes that the home government can precommit to a subsidy function.  The optimal marginal subsidy rate is shown to decrease with domestic exports.  This induces the firms to select steeper supply functions, thereby softening competition.  The strategic complementarity between supply functions' slopes is the key to these results.

AB We develop a private-information model of union contract negotiations in which disputes signal a firm's willingness to pay.  Previous models have assumed that all labor disputes take the form of a strike.  Yet a prominent feature of U.S. collective bargaining is the holdout:  negotiations often continue without a strike after the contract has expired.  Production continues with workers paid according to the expired contract.  We analyze the union's decision to strike or hold out and highlight its importance to strike activity.  Strikes are more likely to occur after a drop in the real wage or a decline in unemployment.

AB The conventional wisdom that nominal wages became less sensitive to the business cycle and more autocorrelated after World War II is reexamined here by considering whether these properties are artifacts of the methods used to construct prewar wage series.  A replication based on these methods is more cyclically sensitive and exhibits less autocorrelation than the postwar data.  Aggregation using variable instead of fixed employment weights also greatly exaggerates the cyclicality of prewar wages.  These biases imply that wages are just as sensitive to the cycle today as 100 years ago, perhaps even more so.

The major conclusion is that beginning in late 1930, and possibly as early as late 1929, deflation could have been anticipated at horizons of 3-6 months.  This implies, in turn, that short-run ex ante real interest rates were very high during the initial phases of the Great Depression.  These results provide further support for the proposition that monetary contraction was the driving force behind the economic decline.

Based on the historical correlations between commodity prices and consumer prices, commodity markets anticipated stable consumer prices during the first year of the Great Depression.  The dramatic drop in nominal Treasury-bill yields thus should be read as a drop in ex ante real rates.  Later in the Great Depression, markets anticipated deflation, but not as severe as actually occurred.

A distinguishing feature of the analysis is that the welfare loss from inflation, the money-demand function, and the time path of inflation are jointly derived from first principles of government and private-sector intertemporal optimization.  Quarterly data for Argentina, Brazil, and Israel are used in implementing the model.  Although the overidentifying restrictions of the model are not rejected in most cases, there are several data points characterized by higher rates of inflation than the optimal rates under precommitment.

AB The prevalence of labor contracts with fixed duration seems surprising.  Why is a fixed duration preferred to a stochastic duration that depends on the consumer price index?  In this paper, the specification of the contract duration is determined endogeneously.  The wage rate can be indexed to the consumer price index, but there is a loss since the indexation must be the same for different types of shocks.  This loss increases with the variability of the contract duration.  Since the loss due to the contracting cost depends on the expected discounted duration only, a fixed duration is chosen.

The technology endows agents with correctly specified economic models, but the cost of expectation calculation using these models leads to gradual and incomplete adjustment to long-run rational-expectations equilibrium.  The rational-expectations hypothesis emerges as a special case of the equilibrium paths obtained in our framework.  In a natural-rate model of monetary policy, calculation technology gives rise to long-run nonneutrality and hysteresis effects, and incomplete adjustment of forecast rules causes output fluctuations to be amplified.

AB Causal relations between federal expenditure and taxation are analyzed using an approach based on the invariance of econometric relationships in the face of structural interventions.  Institutional evidence for interventions or changes of regime combined with econometric tests for structural breaks are used to investigate the relative stability of conditional and marginal probability distributions for each variable.  The patterns of stability are the products of underlying causal order.  We find two distinct causal structures operating in the postwar era.  Before the mid-1960's, taxes appear to cause spending.  After the late 1960's, taxes and spending are causally independent.

AB In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to identify binary threshold crossing models and binary choice models without imposing any parametric structure either on the systematic function of observable exogenous variables or on the distribution of the random term. This identification result is employed to develop a fully nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for both the function of observable exogenous variables and the distribution of the random term. The estimator is shown to be strongly consistent. and a two step procedure for its calculation is developed. The paper also includes examples of economic models that satisfy the conditions that are necessary to apply the results.

We derive the limiting null distribution of the resulting test and compare its local power to that of the standard procedure. It turns out that neither version is uniformly superior to the other.

DE AGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLD MODELS; RURAL LABOR MARKETS; LABOR DEMAND
ID EXPENDITURE SYSTEM; CONSUMPTION; DECISIONS; PEASANT; FAMILY
AB Complete and competitive markets imply a separation of the consumption (labor supply) and production (labor demand) decisions of the farm household. This paper tests for separation using the observation that in the absence of labor markets, household composition is an important determinant of farm labor use. The test has power when off-farm employment or hiring constraints, or differing efficiencies of family and hired labor lead to demographic variables affecting farm labor demand. An empirical model is developed to test the proposition that household labor demand (farm employment) is independent of family composition. The model is estimated on a household-farm data set from rural Java. Measurement error and endogeneity issues are addressed with instrumental variables techniques. I cannot reject the null hypothesis that farm labor allocation decisions are independent of household structure. The results are robust to different specifications of the labor demand function.

TI A MODEL OF GROWTH THROUGH CREATIVE DESTRUCTION
SO ECONOMETRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; INNOVATIONS; CREATIVE DESTRUCTION
ID CYCLES
AB A model of endogenous growth is developed in which vertical innovations, generated by a competitive research sector, constitute the underlying source of growth. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment is constant and GNP follows a random walk with drift, although under some circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular, the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also makes innovations too small.

AB This paper presents a stochastic differential formulation of recursive utility. Sufficient conditions are given for existence, uniqueness, time consistency, monotonicity, continuity, risk aversion, concavity, and other properties. In the setting of Brownian information, recursive and intertemporal expected utility functions are observationally distinguishable. However, one cannot distinguish between a number of non-expected-utility theories of one-shot choice under uncertainty after they are suitably integrated into an intertemporal framework. In a "smooth" Markov setting, the stochastic differential utility model produces a generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman characterization of optimality. A companion paper explores the implications for asset prices.

AB In most models of asymmetric information, possession of private information leads to rents for the possessors. This tends to induce mechanism designers to distort away from efficiency. We show that this is an artifact of the presumption that information is independently distributed. Rent extraction in a large class of mechanism design games is analyzed, and a necessary and sufficient condition for arbitrarily small rents to private information is provided. In addition, the two person bargaining game is shown to have an efficient solution under first order stochastic dominance and a hazard rate condition. Similar conditions lead to full rent extraction in Milgrom-Weber auctions.

ID QUANTITY
AB This paper estimates the effects of school quality-measured by the pupil/teacher ratio, average term length, and relative teacher pay-on the rate of return to education for men born between 1920 and 1949.  Using earnings data from the 1980 census, we find that men who were educated in states with higher-quality schools have a higher return to additional years of schooling.  Rates of return are also higher for individuals from states with better-educated teachers and with a higher fraction of female teachers.  Holding constant school quality measures, however, we find no evidence that parental income or education affects average state-level rates of return.

ID MORAL HAZARD
AB We study environments in which agents may borrow sequentially from more than one lender.  Although debt is prioritized, additional lending imposes an externality on prior debt because, with moral hazard, the probability of repayment of prior loans decreases.  Equilibrium interest rates are higher than they would be if borrowers could commit to borrow from at most one bank.  Even though the loan terms are less favorable than they would be under commitment, the indebtedness of borrowers is greater.  Further, additional lending causes the probability of default to increase.  The results apply to markets for consumer, corporate, and international debt.

More important, it imposed severe deflation on China, the only major country still on a silver standard, and forced it off the silver standard and on to a fiat standard, which brought forward in time and increased in severity the subsequent wartime inflation and postwar hyperinflation.  The silver purchase program thereby contributed, though perhaps only modestly, to the ultimate triumph of the Communists.

AB An empirical investigation of trade-offs between number of children and their scholastic performance confirms that family size directly affects children's achievement.  Though parents show no favoritism to first-born children, being early in the birth order implies a distinct advantage, entirely because of the higher probability of being in a small family.  Recent large changes in family size explain a portion of aggregate test score declines, but increased divorce rates and market work by mothers have no apparent impact.  Finally, teachers are shown to differ enormously, even though performance differences are poorly captured by commonly measured teacher characteristics.  The evidence supports a teacher skill interpretation of differences in classroom achievement.

ID INDIVISIBLE LABOR; LAYOFFS; EQUILIBRIUM; SEARCH; TIME
AB The potential welfare benefits of unemployment insurance, along with the optimal replacement ratio, are studied using a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model.  To provide a role for unemployment insurance, agents in our economy face exogenous idiosyncratic employment shocks and are unable to borrow or insure themselves through private markets.  In the absence of moral hazard, replacement ratios as high as .65 are optimal and the welfare benefits of unemployment insurance are quite large.  However, if there is moral hazard and the replacement ratio is not set optimally, but is instead set to an empirically plausible value, the economy can be much worse off than it would be without unemployment insurance.

ID QUANTITY THEORY; FAILURE; ECONOMY
AB In a long-standing controversy over monetary experiences in colonial America, the main substantive issue concerns large and rapid increases in stocks of paper currency that were followed by negligible changes in price levels.  The "backing theory" or anticlassical interpretation is that prices failed to respond to major increases in total money supplies.  The "quantity theory" or classical hypothesis, by contrast, is that specie was exported in amounts that left total money stocks approximately unchanged.  This paper develops and applies a strategy for resolving this fundamental disagreement despite the absence of data on stocks and flows of specie.

AB Productive factors, such as human and physical capital, accumulate, and trade policy can affect their steady-state levels. Consequently, in addition to the usual static effects, trade liberalization has dynamic effects on output and welfare as the economy moves to its new steady state. The output impact of this dynamic effect is measurable and appears to be quite large. The welfare impact of this dynamic effect is also measurable. The size of this dynamic gain from trade depends on the wedge between social and private returns to capital. Rough numerical estimates of the output and welfare effects are provided.

AB This paper explores the implications for the pattern of international trade of differences among regions within countries-what we call "lumpiness."  If factors of production are sufficiently unevenly distributed across regions, then the pattern of trade of the country as a whole may depart from what it would have been had factors been evenly distributed.  Thus lumpiness in the geographical distribution of factors can be a determinant of trade.  We show in particular that if other determinants of trade are absent, then a country will tend to export the good that intensively uses its lumpier (i.e., more unevenly distributed) factor.

AB The era of wage stretching has been a current focus, but we direct attention here to a decade of extraordinary wage compression-the 1940s.  Wages narrowed by education, job experience, and occupation, and compression occurred within cells.  The 90-10 differential in the log of wages for men was 1.45 in 1940 but 1.06 in 1950.  By the late 1980s it returned to its 1940 level, thus restoring a dispersion of 50 years ago.  World War II and the National War Labor Board share some credit for the Great Compression, but much was due to an increased demand for unskilled labor when educated labor was greatly expanding.

AB A simple supply and demand framework is used to analyze changes in the U.S.  wage structure from 1963 to 1987.  Rapid secular growth in the demand for more-educated workers, "more-skilled" workers, and females appears to be the driving force behind observed changes in the wage structure.  Measured changes in the allocation of labor between industries and occupations strongly favored college graduates and females throughout the period.  Movements in the college wage premium over this period appear to be strongly related to fluctuations in the rate of growth of the supply of college graduates.

AB This paper uses micro data from the Current Population Surveys to document the secular decline in labor market activity among prime age men from 1967 to 1987.  Declines in employment occur at all ages but are found to be particularly severe among less-educated and low-wage men.  Information on the cross-section wage-employment relationship and on actual wage changes indicates that the initial fall in employment from the late 1960s to the early 1970s is entirely attributable to falling labor supply whereas since the early 1970s, wage changes predict most of the decline in employment for whites and approximately half of the decline for blacks.

AB This paper analyzes the extent to which ethnic skill differentials are transmitted across generations.  I assume that ethnicity acts as an externality in the human capital accumulation process.  The skills of the next generation depend on parental inputs and on the quality of the ethnic environment in which parents make their investments, or "ethnic capital."  The empirical evidence reveals that the skills of today's generation depend not only on the skills of their parents, but also on the average skills of the ethnic group in the parent's generation.

AB The wage differential between black and white men fell from 40 percent in 1960 to 25 percent in 1980.  It has been argued that this convergence reflects improvements in the relative quality of black schools.  To test this hypothesis, we assembled data on pupil-teacher ratios, annual teacher pay, and term length for black and white schools in the eighteen segregated states from 1915 to 1966.  These data are linked to estimated returns to education for Southern-born men from different cohorts and states in 1960, 1970, and 1980.  Improvements in the relative quality of black schools explain 20 percent of the narrowing of the black-white earnings gap between 1960 and 1980.

AB This paper shows a widening in black-white earnings and employment gaps among young men from the mid-1970s through the 1980s.  Earnings gaps increased most among college graduates and in the Midwest, while gaps in employment-population rates grew most among dropouts.  We attribute the differential widening to shifts in demand for subgroups due to shifting industry and regional employment, the falling real minimum wage and deunionization, the growing supply of black to white workers that was marked among college graduates, and to increased crime among dropouts.  The different factors affecting subgroups highlight the economic diversity of black Americans.

AB This paper examines why Canadian poverty rates fell relative to U.S. poverty rates during the periods 1970-1979 and 1979-1986.  During the 1970s the principal reason for declining Canadian poverty rates is higher economic growth.  During the 1980s, however, differences in government transfer policy are the main cause of relative poverty change in the two countries.  Virtually all of the 3.3 point fall in relative Canadian/U.S. poverty rates from 1979 to 1986 can be attributed to expansions in the Canadian transfer system and simultaneous contractions in U.S.  transfers.

AB This paper investigates the effect of increased import competition on U.S. manufacturing employment and wages, using data for a panel of manufacturing industries over the 1977-1987 period.  The empirical analysis uses previously unavailable industry import price data and an instrumental variables estimation strategy.  The estimates suggest that changes in import prices have a significant effect on both employment and wages.  The dramatic appreciation of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 is estimated to have reduced wages by 2 percent, and employment by 4.5-7.5 percent on average in this sample of trade-impacted industries.

AB Although surveys show that traditional orderings of average wage-i.e., higher earnings with higher schooling and concave age-wage profiles-have not changed during the past three decades, the actual size of the wage differentials measured by education or by work experience has varied from peak to trough by a factor of two-to-one.  The patterns are not monotone, but there is a trend toward increased skill premiums.  We first examine the structure of wages among white men distinguished by age and schooling for the period from 1963 to 1989.  We then compare shifts in the distribution of wages and employment among the age x schooling categories to show in reference to a stable demand structure that employment alone cannot account for observed changes in relative wages.  Finally, we describe the characteristics required of candidate demand shifters and offer examples using linear trend, business cycle shocks, and recent patterns of deficits in international trade.

AB In many circumstances, a principal may have relevant private information when she proposes a contract to an agent. We analyze such a principal-agent relationship as a noncooperative game. The principal proposes a contract, which is accepted or rejected by the agent (who, for most of our analysis, has no private information). The contract is executed if accepted; otherwise, the reservation allocation takes effect. This allocation may be determined by a pre-existing contract (which the principal, by her proposal, is attempting to renegotiate), or it may simply be the no-trade point. In this paper, we assume that the principal's information directly affects the agent's payoff.
   Before solving the game, we discuss Pareto efficiency with asymmetric information. We define an incentive-compatible allocation to be weakly interim efficient (WIE) if there exists no alternative incentive-compatible allocation that both parties prefer for all possible beliefs that the agent might have about the principal's private information (type). We show that any WIE allocation is interim-efficient (IE) for some beliefs.
   The Rothschild-Stiglitz-Wilson (RSW) allocation relative to the reservation allocation mu-0. is the allocation that maximizes the payoff of each type of principal within the class of incentive-compatible allocations that guarantee the agent at least the utility he gets from mu-0. irrespective of his beliefs about the principal's type. The equilibrium set of the contract proposal game consists of the allocations that weakly Pareto dominate the RSW allocation. Thus, there is a unique equilibrium outcome if and only if the latter is IE (and the equilibrium outcome is the RSW allocation itself).
   After characterizing the equilibrium allocations, we study those that are renegotiation-proof, when either the principal or the agent leads the renegotiation. We then compare our contract proposal game, which is a signaling model, with its "screening" counterpart. We conclude by extending our results to the case in which the agent as well as the principal has private information under the assumption of quasi-linear preferences.

AB Much macroeconometric discussion has recently emphasized the economic significance of the size of the permanent component in GNP. Consequently, a large literature has developed that tries to estimate this magnitude-measured, essentially, as the spectral density of increments in GNP at frequency zero. This paper shows that unless the permanent component is a random walk this attention has been misplaced: in general, that quantity does not identify the magnitude of the permanent component. Further, by developing bounds on reasonable measures of this magnitude, the paper shows that a random walk specification is biased towards establishing the permanent component as important.

AB This paper develops a new procedure for statistical inference in cointegrating regressions. We introduce the concept of canonical cointegrating regressions, which are the regressions formulated with the transformed data. The required transformations involve simple adjustments of the integrated processes using stationary components in cointegrating models. Canonical cointegrating regressions therefore represent the same cointegrating relationships as the original models. They are, however, constructed in such a way that the usual least squares procedure yields asymptotically efficient estimators and chi-square tests. The methodology presented here is applicable to a very wide class of cointegrating models, including models with deterministic and singular, as well as stochastic and regular, cointegrations.

AB We develop a new form of the information matrix test for a wide variety of statistical models. Chesher (1984) showed that the implicit alternative of this test is a model with random parameter variation, a fact which we exploit by constructing the test against an explicit alternative of this type. The new test is computed using a double-length artificial regression, instead of the more conventional outer-product-of-the-gradient regression, which, although easy to use, is known to give test statistics with distributions very far from the asymptotic nominal distribution even in rather large samples. The new form on the other hand performs remarkably well, at least for the case of univariate regression models. Some approximate finite-sample distributions are calculated for this case, and lend support to the use of the new form of the test.

   MODEL SPECIFICATION
ID HETEROSCEDASTICITY; COEFFICIENTS
AB This paper proposes a new test statistic to detect the presence of heteroskedasticity. The proposed test does not require a parametric specification of the mean regression function in the first stage regression.
   The regression function is estimated nonparametrically by the kernel estimation method. The nonparametric residual is estimated and used as a proxy for the random disturbance term. This nonparametric residual is robust to regression function misspecification. Asymptotic normality is established using extensions of classical U-statistic theorems. When the disturbance term is heteroskedastic, nonparametric residuals will correctly identify the presence of heteroskedasticity.
   The test statistic is computed using the nonparametric quantities, but the resulting inference has a standard chi-square distribution.

TI ON THE BEHAVIOR OF COMMODITY PRICES
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECULATION; STORAGE
AB This paper applies the standard rational expectations competitive storage model to the study of thirteen commodities.  It explains the skewness, and the existence of rare but violent explosions in prices, coupled with a high degree of price autocorrelation in more normal times.  A central feature of the model is the explicit recognition of the fact that it is impossible for the market as a whole to carry negative inventories, and this introduces an essential non-linearity which carries through into non-linearity of the predicted commodity price series.  For most of the thirteen commodity prices, the behaviour of prices from one year to the next conforms to the predictions of the theory about conditional expectations and conditional variances.  However, given the non-linearity both of the model and of the actual prices, such conformity is not enough to ensure that the theory yields a complete account of the data.  In particular, the analysis does not yield a fully satisfactory explanation for the high autocorrelation observed in the data.

AB Estimated U.S. M1 demand functions appear unstable, regularly "breaking down," over 1960-1988 (e.g. missing money, great velocity decline, M1-explosion).  We propose a money demand function whose arguments include inflation, real income, long-term bond yield and risk, T-bill interest rates, and learning curve weighted yields on newly introduced instruments in M1 and non-transactions M2.  The model is estimated in dynamic error-correction form; it is constant and, with an equation standard error of 0.4%, variance-dominates most previous models.  Estimating alternative specifications explains earlier "breakdowns," showing the model's distinctive features to be important in accounting for the data.

ID REPEATED GAMES
AB The present paper extends the theory of self-enforcing agreements in a long-term relationship (the Folk Theorem in repeated games) to the situation where agents change their partners over time.  Cooperation is sustained because defection against one agent causes sanction by others, and the paper shows how such a "social norm" is sustained by self-interested agents under various degrees of observability.  Two main results are presented.  The first one is an example where a community can sustain cooperation even when each agent knows nothing more than his personal experience.  The second shows a Folk Theorem that the community can realize any mutually beneficial outcomes when each agent carries a label such as reputation, membership, or licence, which are revised in a systematic way.

AB The present paper tries to explain cooperative behaviour in an organization run by a sequence of long- but finitely-lived agents.  We show that the Folk Theorem holds for infinitely repeated games with overlapping generations of finitely-lived players; any mutually beneficial outcome can approximately be sustained if the player's life span and the overlapping periods are long enough.  The result is stronger than the usual Folk Theorems in that it employs no assumption on the stage game, such as the full dimensionality of payoff set of multiplicity of equilibria.

AB A model of sequential bargaining with one-sided incomplete information is analyzed where, if an agreement is not reached, the agents go to court.  A "deadline effect" emerges where much settlement occurs just prior to the trial, and many cases proceed to court.  If fixed costs are incurred during each bargaining period, a "U-shaped" pattern of settlement emerges.  These patterns persist in the limit as the time between offers approaches zero.  A model with an endogenous trial date is also considered, and it is shown that even with complete information, there exist inefficient equilibria where disputes are resolved in court.

AB This paper describes several learning processes which converge, with probability one, to the rational expectations (Bayesian-Nash) equilibrium of a stationary linear game.  The learning processes include a test for convergence to equilibrium, and a method for changing the parameters of the process when non-convergence is indicated.  This self-stabilization property eliminates the need to impose stability conditions on the economic environment.  Convergence to equilibrium is proved for two types of self-stabilizing learning mechanisms:  a centralized forecasting mechanism and a decentralized strategy adjustment process.

TI COMPETITIVE PROFITS IN THE LONG-RUN
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Profit rates differ across industries.  Explanations have often relied on static models of imperfect competition.  This paper develops a dynamic model of perfect competition to demonstrate that long-run average profit rates differ even across competitive industries when the effects of sunk costs on entry and exit are considered.  The hypothesis that firms maximize their present expected values has few empirical implications for long-run average profit rates, but it does have implications for the behaviour of variables over time; for example, industries with high variability in the number of firms should exhibit low variability in firm values.

ID COMPETITION; CAPACITY; DUOPOLY; OLIGOPOLY; MARKET; ROLES
AB This paper analyzes duopolistic price-leadership games in which firms have capacity constraints.  We provide a complete characterization of price leader equilibria under quite general assumptions on demand and for arbitrary capacities.  We show that when capacities are in the range where the simultaneous-move price-setting game (with efficiently rationed demand) yields a mixed-strategy solution the large firm is indifferent between being a leader, a follower, or moving simultaneously.  The small firm, while indifferent between being a leader and moving simultaneously, strictly prefers to be a follower.  This motivates the discussion of games of timing with ex-post inflexible prices in which the large firm becomes an endogenously determined price leader.  We thus provide a game-theoretic model of dominant-firm price leadership.

AB We consider a Bertrand-Edgeworth model of price competition.  Firms have identical and constant marginal costs and finite exogeneous capacities.  Firms choose prices.  Our interest is in the set of those prices which are left over after the iterated elimination of dominated strategies.  We show that in two circumstances this set will be close to the set containing only the market-clearing (Walrasian) price:  (i) if any n - 1 out of n firms assumed to be in the market have sufficient capacity to cover demand at marginal costs; (ii) if any given total capacity is owned by a very large number of very small firms.

AB This paper develops an explanation of why bargainers often terminate negotiations in disagreement in spite of positive expected gains from continued negotiation.  The key to the analysis is a model which embeds bargaining activity within a market.  Agents are continually faced with the choice between continuing to bargain with an existing partner or searching for a new partner.  Bargainers may then terminate negotiations without an agreement, in spite of positive expected gains from continued bargaining, because seeking a new bargaining partner promises a higher return.

AB The role of strategic delay is analyzed in an infinite-horizon alternating-offer model of bargaining.  A buyer and seller are engaged in the trade of a single object.  Both bargainers have private information about their own preferences and are impatient in that delaying agreement is costly.  An equilibrium is constructed in which the bargainers signal the strength of their bargaining positions by delaying prior to making an offer.  A bargainer expecting large gains from trade is more impatient than one expecting small gains, and hence makes concessions earlier on.  Trade occurs whever gains from trade exist, but due to the private information, only after costly delay.

AB In an experiment comparing related two-person bargaining and multiperson market environments in Israel, Japan, the United States, and Yugoslavia, market outcomes converged to equilibrium everywhere, and there were no payoff-relevant differences among countries. However, bargaining outcomes were everywhere different from the equilibrium predictions (both in observed agreements and in the substantial frequency of observed disagreements), and substantial differences were observed among countries. Because of the way the experiment was designed, the fact that the market behavior is the same in all countries supports the hypothesis that the differences in bargainingbehavior among countries are not due to differences in languages, currencies, or experiments but may tentatively be attributed to cultural differences.

TI A COMPARATIVE MODEL OF BARGAINING - THEORY AND EVIDENCE
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

DT Article
AB Recent laboratory studies of alternating-offer bargaining find many empirical regularities that are inconsistent with the standard theory. In this paper, I postulate that bargainers behave as if they are negotiating over both "absolute" and "relative" money.  Absolute money is measured by cash, relative money by the disparity between absolute measures.  The resulting model is consistent with previously observed regularities.  New experiments provide further support as well as evidence against several alternative explanations.  Also finding some support is an extension which predicts that the equilibrium of the standard theory will be observed when bargaining is done in a "tournament" setting.

ID RAISING RIVALS COSTS
AB Ordinarily, a monopoly cannot increase its profits by asking customers to sign agreements not to deal with potential competitors.  If, however, there are 100 customers and the minimum efficient scale requires serving 15, the monopoly need only lock up 86 customers to forestall entry.  If each customer believes that the others will sign, each also believes that no rival seller will enter.  Hence, an individual customer loses nothing by signing the exclusionary agreement and will indeed sign.  Thus, naked exclusion can be profitable.

AB Why do governments so often fail to adopt policies which economists consider to be efficiency-enhancing?  Our answer to this question relies on uncertainty regarding the distribution of gains and losses from reform.   We show that there is a bias towards the status quo (and hence against efficiency-enhancing reforms) whenever some of the individual gainers and losers from reform cannot be identified beforehand.  There are reforms which, once adopted, will receive adequate political support but would have failed to carry the day ex ante.  The argument does not rely on risk aversion, irrationality, or hysteresis due to sunk costs.

AB A new welfare-enhancing role is identified for a policy of export subsidization in a new-product industry.  An export-subsidy policy promotes the (rational) perception that a high-quality export can be provided at a relatively low price.  Thus, an export subsidy generates a first-order benefit to welfare by enabling a high-quality export to be sold at a less-distorted high price.  The subsidy will also introduce distortions into the price of a low-quality export and the quality-selection process.  Since these choices are initially undistorted, however, the export-country welfare loss arising from new distortions is of second-order importance.

AB When a stabilization has significant distributional implications (e.g., tax increases to eliminate a large budget deficit), socioeconomic groups may attempt to shift the burden of stabilization onto other groups.  The process leading to stabilization becomes a "war of attrition," each group attempting to wait the others out and stabilization occurring only when one group concedes and bears a disproportionate share of the burden.  We solve for the expected time of stabilization in a model of "rational" delay and relate it to several political and economic variables.  We motivate this approach and its results by comparison to historical and current episodes.

AB Several puzzling aspects of the behavior of United States stock prices may be explained by the presence of a specific type of rational bubble that depends exclusively on aggregate dividends.  We call bubbles of this type "intrinsic" bubbles because they derive all of their variability from exogenous economic fundamentals and none from extraneous factors.  Intrinsic bubbles provide a more plausible empirical account of deviations from present-value pricing than do the traditional examples of rational bubbles.  Their explanatory potential comes partly from their ability to generate persistent deviations that appear to be relatively stable over long periods.

A real-business-cycle model with endogenous growth is developed and estimated with U.S. data.  In the present framework,  wage movements do not have to be transitory to generate fluctuations in labor effort.  The reduced form is a constrained bivariate output/hours (or real-wage/hours) VAR process.  The bivariate setup provides a useful framework for analyzing the persistence of output fluctuations, given that the theory implies that hours of work contain information about future output movements.

AB Is consumption more or less variable than predicted by the permanent-income hypothesis (PIH)?  To answer that question, I develop a procedure based on a long-run restriction implied by the consumer's intertemporal budget constraint.  In contrast to previous work, the approach here (i) does not require any assumptions on the stochastic properties of labor income, (ii) does not impose restrictions on the consumer's information set, and (iii) is robust to departures from the PIH model.  The application of the procedure to postwar U.S. data suggests that consumption is smoother than the PIH model predicts.

AB We present evidence from the United States and the United Kingdom that the persistence of price inflation is significantly higher under managed-exchange-rate regimes than under gold-based, fixed-exchange-rate regimes.  These differences are also reflected in expectations-augmented Phillips curves.  We use a two-country macro model, with forward-looking price setters, to demonstrate that higher monetary accomodation of inflation and exchange-rate accommodation of inflation differentials increase inflation persistence.  The evidence does not contradict this hypothesis.  It supports the hypothesis of forward-looking price setters and highlights the empirical significance of the Lucas critique.

ID HOUSING-MARKET; CONSUMPTION; MONEY
AB The effects of the changing U.S. age distribution on various macroeconomic equations are examined in this paper.  The equations include consumption, housing-investment, money-demand, and labor-force-participation equations.  There seems to be enough variance in the age-distribution data to allow reasonably precise estimates of the effects of the age distribution on the macro variables.

TI EXPLAINING SERVICE-PRICE DIFFERENCES IN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS; COUNTRIES
AB This paper reexamines observed international differences in the price of services and the positive correlation of these with per capita GDP differences. Using a general trade model with a nontraded sector, we find that differences in countries' factor endowments, populations, trade policies, and trade balances will have ambiguous and sometimes opposite effects on their service prices and real incomes. Estimating the service-price equation using recent data suggests that larger endowments of agricultural land, minerals, and capital, larger trade deficits, and higher prices for tradables increase service prices. Conversely, larger populations and labor forces reduce service prices.

AB A sufficient condition for market demand to satisfy the Law of Demand is that the mean of all households' income effect matrices be positive definite. We show how this mean income effect matrix can be estimated from cross section data under metonymy, an assumption about the distribution of households' characteristics. The estimation procedure uses the nonparametric method of average derivatives. Income effect matrices estimated this way from U.K. family expenditure data are in fact positive definite. This result can be explained by a special form of heteroskedasticity in the data: households' demands are more dispersed at higher income levels.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present the likelihood methods for the analysis of cointegration in VAR models with Gaussian errors, seasonal dummies, and constant terms. We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the chi-2 distribution.

AB A Bayesian analysis of the linear regression model with only parts of the prior distribution specified or a robust Bayesian analysis lead to sets of posterior distributions. The so-called feasible ellipsoid of Leamer (1978) describes the region of posterior means if for conjugate priors the prior covariance matrix is varying in the set of symmetric positive-definite matrices. As an extension to Bayesian confidence sets (HPD regions, i.e. regions of highest posterior probability) we introduce the concept of HiFi (high fiduciary) regions. The HiFi region is a union of HPD regions, and is a tool for describing the dependence of the posterior distribution on the prior covariance. In this paper we assume that the prior covariance matrix varies in an interval of positive definite matrices.

AB While technically p-values should not be interpreted as probabilities, they often are, and their usual asymptotic equivalence to Bayesian posterior tail probabilities provides an approximate justification for doing so. In inference about possibly nonstationary dynamic models the usual asymptotic equivalence fails, however. We show with three-dimensional graphs bow it is possible that in autoregressive models the distribution of the estimator is skewed asymptotically, while the likelihood and hence the posterior pdf remains symmetric. We show that no single prior can rationalize treating p-values as probabilities in these models, and we display examples of the sample-dependent "priors" that would do so. We argue that these results imply at a minimum that the usual test statistics and covariance matrices for autoregressions, which characterize the likelihood shape in dynamic models just as in static regression models, should be reported without any corrections for the special unit root distribution theory, even if the corrected classical p-values are reported as well.

AB The invariance properties of some well known asymptotic tests are studied. Three types of invariance are considered: invariance to the representation of the null hypothesis, invariance to one-to-one transformations of the parameter space (reparameterizations), and invariance to one-to-one transformations of the model variables such as changes in measurement units. Tests that are not invariant include the Wald test and generalized versions of it, a widely used variant of the Lagrange multiplier test, Neyman's C(alpha) test, and a generalized version of the latter. For all these tests, we show that simply changing measurement units can lead to vastly different answers even when equivalent null hypotheses are tested. This problem is illustrated by considering regression models with Box-Cox transformations on the variables. We observe, in particular, that various consistent estimators of the information matrix lead to test procedures with different invariance properties. General sufficient conditions are then established, under which the generalized C(alpha) test becomes invariant to reformulations of the null hypothesis and/or to one-to-one transformations of the parameter space as well as to transformations of the variables. In many practical cases where Wald-type tests lack invariance, we find that special formulations of the generalized C(alpha) test are invariant and hardly more costly to compute than Wald tests. This computational simplicity stands in contrast with other invariant tests such as the likelihood ratio test. We conclude that noninvariant asymptotic tests should be avoided or used with great care. Further, in many situations, the suggested implementation of the generalized C(alpha) test often yields an attractive substitute to the Wald test (which is not invariant) and to other invariant tests (which are more costly to perform).

AB This paper demonstrates that an optimizing model of a monetary economy can produce perfect foresight equilibria, in which the price level fluctuates forever. Cyclically or chaotically fluctuating equilibria are more likely to exist when the rate of money supply growth is high. Furthermore, the set of equilibrium prices may have a complicated topological structure, which poses a more serious problem concerning the validity of comparative statics method than any sort of indeterminacy previously discussed in the literature.

AB This paper analyzes asset prices in an exchange economy in which the preferences of the representative agent exhibit habit formation. For a general class of utility indices and endowment processes we (i) characterize the optimal demand for consumption, and (ii) derive closed form solutions for the interest rate and the excess return on risky assets. Our analysis demonstrates that consumption smoothness may obtain even when the interest rate is stochastic. In economies with habit formation the consumption CAPM need not hold when the coefficients of the endowment process are stochastic processes; asset risk premia are larger under mild assumptions. The interest rate depends on the growth in the standard of living. Historical consumption as well as possible future consumption paths are determinants of the current interest rate. The analysis provides new testable restrictions on the behavior of financial assets. A new methodology, Malliavin calculus, is introduced to compute equilibrium asset risk premia.

AB In this paper we provide a framework to study the aggregate dynamic behavior of an economy where individual units follow (S,s) policies. We characterize structural and stochastic heterogeneities that ensure convergence of the economy's aggregate to that of its frictionless counterpart, determine the speed at which convergence takes place, and describe the transitional dynamics of this economy.

DT Article
DE ALTRUISM; JOY OF GIVING; FISCAL POLICY; RICARDIAN EQUIVALENCE; BEQUESTS;
   EQUIGENITURE
AB Recent work demonstrates that dynastic assumptions guarantee the irrelevance of all redistributional policies, distortionary taxes, and prices-the neutrality of fiscal policy (Ricardian equivalence) is only the "tip of the iceberg." In this paper, we investigate the possibility of reinstating approximate Ricardian equivalence by introducing a small amount of friction in intergenerational links. If Ricardian equivalence depends upon significantly shorter chains of links than do these stronger neutrality results, then friction may dissipate the effects that generate strong neutrality, without significantly affecting the Ricardian result. Although this intuition turns out to be essentially correct, we show that models with small amounts of friction have other untenable implications. We conclude that the theoretical case for Ricardian equivalence remains tenuous.

AB In a repeated partnership game with imperfect monitoring, we distinguish among the effects of (1) reducing the interest rate, (2) shortening the period over which actions are held fixed, and (3) shortening the lag with which accumulated information is reported. All three changes are equivalent in games with perfect monitoring. With imperfect monitoring, reducing the interest rate always increases the possibilities for cooperation, but the other two changes always have the reverse effect when the interest rate is small.

SO ECONOMETRICA

DE AGENCY; RENEGOTIATION; VERIFIABILITY
ID CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION; INFORMATION; PRINCIPAL
AB We examine the effects of renegotiation in an agency relationship. We show how renegotiation affects: (i) the set of actions the principal can induce the agent to take; and (ii) the cost of implementing a given action. We show that, when the principal receives an unverifiable signal of the agent's action, renegotiation can improve welfare. This result stands in contrast to Fudenberg and Tirole's (1990) finding that renegotiation lowers welfare when the principal receives no signal about the agent's action prior to renegotiation.

TI NO-ENVY AND CONSISTENCY IN ECONOMIES WITH INDIVISIBLE GOODS

DE NO-ENVY; CONSISTENCY; INDIVISIBLE GOODS
AB We consider the problem of fair allocation in economies with indivisible goods. Our main objective is to identify appealing subsolutions of the no-envy solution. We formulate desirable properties of solutions, and look for solutions satisfying them: given an allocation chosen by a solution for some economy and given a subgroup of the agents, consider the problem of fairly distributing among its members the resources that this group has collectively received. The solution is consistent if it recommends that the same bundle be attributed to each of these agents as initially. We show that there is no proper subsolution of the no-envy solution that satisfies consistency. However, many subsolutions satisfy bilateral consistency or the converse of consistency. But again, there is no proper subsolution satisfying these two properties together.

ID SPECIFICATION
AB We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.

The price discrimination and the uncertainty hypotheses appear to better explain the data than the peak load hypothesis. Fashion has become more important over time and appears to explain the greater seasonal variation in retail apparel prices in recent years. Differences in uncertainty also explains differences in the pricing of different types of men's dress shirts.

TI LOSS AVERSION IN RISKLESS CHOICE - A REFERENCE-DEPENDENT MODEL
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAND CHOICE; WILLINGNESS; DISPARITY; PAY
AB Much experimental evidence indicates that choice depends on the status quo or reference level: changes of reference point often lead to reversals of preference. We present a reference-dependent theory of consumer choice, which explains such effects by a deformation of indifference curves about the reference point. The central assumption of the theory is that losses and disadvantages have greater impact on preferences than gains and advantages. Implications of loss aversion for economic behavior are considered.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY; CHINA; MODEL
AB This paper formulates a stochastic dynamic model of fertility to evaluate the assumptions that underlie the widely used econometric tests for parental sex preferences. Unlike previous work on dynamic models of fertility, several tractable and testable predictions are established. It is shown rigorously that conventional econometric tests using fertility data are valid tests for sex preferences; however, they cannot separate son preference from daughter preference. The only definite conclusion that one can draw from fertility data is whether there are sex preferences. These results call into question the validity of conventional econometric tests for son preference.

(2) The threat of producer protection leads to low-powered incentive schemes for regulated firms. (3) Consumer politics may induce uniform pricing by a multiproduct firm. (4) An interest group has more power when its interest lies in inefficient rather than efficient regulation, where inefficiency is measured by the degree of informational asymmetry between the regulated industry and the political principal (Congress).

ID DEMAND
AB I test for the importance of wage rigidities from long-term contracts by observing how employment responds when firms and workers recontract. If rigidities are important, then employment should adjust after recontracting to partially undo its movements during the past contract. I examine twelve manufacturing industries that display a strong bargaining pattern. I find employment does rebound after recontracting, particularly in motor vehicles. This implies that contract rigidities are important. I also find responses in wage growth at the beginning of new contracts; but these responses are not related to the pattern of employment responses across industries.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the recent decline in the fraction of unemployed workers who receive unemployment insurance benefits. Using March Current Population Surveys, we compare the fraction who are potentially eligible for benefits with the fraction who receive them. The decline in insured unemployment is almost entirely due to a decline in the early 1980s in the takeup rate for benefits. We analyze the determinants of the takeup rate, using both aggregated state-level data and micro-data. At least half the decline is due to an increasing share of unemployment in states with lower takeup rates.

AB We examine the connection between exchange rates and foreign direct investment that arises when globally integrated capital markets are subject to informational imperfections. These imperfections cause external financing to be more expensive than internal financing, so that changes in wealth translate into changes in the demand for direct investment. By systematically lowering the relative wealth of domestic agents, a depreciation of the domestic currency can lead to foreign acquisitions of certain domestic assets. We develop a simple model of this phenomenon and test for its relevance in determining international capital flows.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB Troubled debtor countries do not gain by repurchasing external bank debt at market discount, even if a buyback would stimulate investment by relieving debt overhang. The reason is that buybacks allow creditors to reap more than 100 percent of any efficiency gains that might result from increased investment. We show that open-market buybacks provide a benchmark for evaluating more complex negotiated buyback deals. By comparing any given deal with a hypothetical market buyback of the same size, one can derive upper and lower bounds on the gain to the country. We apply our model to the 1990 Mexican debt deal.

AB In many industries, the largest firms are most successful in entering and competing in individual markets or submarkets. While this success is often attributed to cost or quality differences, it may also reflect reputation advantages or marketing strategies that benefit firms selling a wider variety of products in the industry. I present an approach to estimating the advantages of a dominant firm in the airline industry that allows one to effectively control for cost and quality heterogeneity. Results using data from 1986 indicate that an airline with a dominant presence at an airport will have a significant advantage in attracting customers whose trips originate at that airport, regardless of the specific route on which the customer is traveling.

Estimation and testing are based on the probability distributions of inventories derived by Caplin [1985]. The excess volatility of retailers' demand over their consumers' demand, and the "forgetfulness" of inventories under (S, s) are emphasized. Test results indicate that the time series properties of deliveries and sales are consistent with (S, s) and not a quadratic cost model. Finally, when autoregressions of inventories are given an (S, s) rather than a stock adjustment interpretation, traditional empirical problems such as low speeds of adjustment are explained.

The foreign country is compensated with a portion of the tariff revenues or quota rents, but cannot directly observe the political pressure abroad. In this setting, the two countries negotiate over the volume of trade and transfer of rents, depending on the level of political pressure. We determine globally optimal, incentive-compatible trade policies, in which the home government has no incentive to overstate (or understate) the pressure for protection.

On the production side the question is whether prices are more stable in concentrated industries. And on the sales side the question is whether markets where buyers are consumers have more stable prices than those with consumers and speculators. The recent increase in metal-price instability is explained by changes in the market-structure and organization variables. Foremost is increased reliance on commodity-exchanges. Declines in concentration are of less importance.

ID CYCLICAL UNEMPLOYMENT; SECTORAL SHIFTS
AB This paper studies determinants of the geographic distribution of unemployment in the United States since 1950. We argue that "equilibrium" differences in unemployment among markets are partially supported by corresponding differences in the covariance structure of sectoral demands for labor. When workers are mobile, greater diversification of sectoral demands reduces unemployment. We confirm this point using pooled time-series-cross-section data on state unemployment and employment by industry. We also find evidence for nonneutrality of aggregate disturbances based on geographic differences in industrial composition, and that permanent changes in the sectoral composition of employment lead to transitory fluctuations in unemployment.

AB This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of saving behavior.  When consumers are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting consumption against bad draws of income.  The precautionary demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide a motive for holding assets.  If the income process is positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a greater cost in terms of foregone consumption.  In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes.  As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent receives aggregate labor income.  Either there is no saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated.  However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data.  While it is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained by traditional life-cycle models.

AB Using Monte Carlo methodology, this paper investigates the effect of dynamics and simultaneity on the finite sample properties of instrumental variables statistics for testing nested and non-nested hypotheses. Simple numerical-analytical formulae (response surfaces) are obtained which closely approximate the statistics' unknown size and power functions for a dynamic simultaneous equations model. The analysis illustrates the value and limitations of asymptotic theory in interpreting finite sample properties.
   Two practical results arise. The F form of the Wald statistic is favored over its chi-2 form, and "large-sigma" and small "effective" sample size strongly affect the test of over-identifying restrictions and the Cox-type test.

AB A test for long-run memory that is robust to short-range dependence is developed. It is an extension of the "range over standard deviation" or R/S statistic, for which the relevant asymptotic sampling theory is derived via functional central limit theory. This test is applied to daily and monthly stock returns indexes over several time periods and, contrary to previous findings, there is no evidence of long-range dependence in any of the indexes over any sample period or sub-period once short-range dependence is taken into account. Illustrative Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the modified R/S test has power against at least two specific models of long-run memory, suggesting that stochastic models of short-range dependence may adequately capture the time series behavior of stock returns.

AB This paper introduces a semiparametric estimation method for polychotomous choice models.  The method does not require a parametric structure for the systematic subutility of observable exogenous variables.  The distribution of the random terms is assumed to be known up to a finite-dimensional parameter vector.  In contrast, previous semiparametric methods of estimating discrete choice models have concentrated on relaxing parametric assumptions on the distribution of the random terms while leaving the systematic subutility parametrically specified.
   The systematic subutility is assumed to possess properties, such as monotonicity and concavity, that are typically assumed in microeconomic theory.  The estimator for the systematic subutility and the parameter vector of the distribution is shown to be strongly consistent.  A computational technique to calculate the estimators is developed.

AB This paper discusses frequency domain methods of statistical inference for time series, in which the degree of smoothing in nonparametric spectral density estimation is determined from the data.  A result on uniform convergence of spectral density estimates is established and applied in developing robust large-sample inference procedures based on instrumental variables estimates of a fairly general linear system with disturbances that have serial correlation of unknown form.  Optimal instruments depend on the spectral density of the disturbances and on the frequency response function, and the latter is also nonparametric when the system is incomplete.  The system may be parameterized over only a proper subset of the sampling frequencies.  We adapt to these nonparametric features, justifying feasible, asymptotically optimal parameter estimates.  The above results all assume covariance stationarity of the data, except for the special case of a multivariate linear regression model for which certain trending explanatory variables are permitted.  In all these results, the degree of smoothing is allowed to depend on the data in a quite general way.  The major technical achievement of the paper is to justify under primitive conditions the consistency of a particular, cross-validation, method of automatically determining a desirable degree of smoothing, which we apply to a multiple regression model.  A Monte Carlo study illustrates our methodology and examines its performance in small and moderate samples.

AB The theory applying to dynamic programming has furnished a useful set of techniques for the analysis of many types of sequential models.  This theory, however, has not yielded heretofore much information about the differentiability properties of optimal solutions.  This aspect is of particular interest as regards the qualitative analysis of optimal paths, where differentiable methods are often called into play.  This paper shows roughly that if the objective is twice continuously differentiable and strongly concave, then any interior optimal path is continuously differentiable with respect to the initial state.

AB The following characterization of Walrasian allocations is proved:  an allocation for an exchange economy with C1 preferences is Walrasian if there is a set of net trades that (i) contains all sums of elements of itself, (ii) contains the negation of any net trade that would improve some agent in the final position, and (iii) is such that the bundles in the allocation are weakly preferred to those obtainable from the initial endowments by means of the given set of net trades.  These conditions are similar to ones studied by Schmeidler and Vind (1972) and Vind (1978), but here they are thought of as characterizing the set of net trades available in steady state equilibria of market games like those studied by Douglas Gale (1984, 1985, 1986a, 1986b, and 1986c).  The characterization result is used as a key step in the proof of results like Gale's:  the allocations induced by steady state equilibria are Walrasian for the economy given by the (constant) flow of new agents into the market.  Our approach generalizes the one followed in Gale (1986c) and allows us to dispense with assumptions made in previous treatments.  For example Gale's (1986a) assumption of dispersed characteristics is dropped.  We also demonstrate that such a result depends on the assumption that agents cannot observe the past behavior of agents with whom they trade.

AB A matching technology is proposed which permits the analysis of decentralized matching problems in which sellers can publicly commit to a trading price that differs from the price at which buyers expect to trade elsewhere in the market.  The equilibrium path with this form of ex ante pricing is compared with the path for trading prices that prevails when prices are determined ex post by bargaining.  It is shown that when demand and supply are nearly equal, the equilibrium ex ante price offer will lie below the Nash bargaining split, while this relationship will be reversed when the level of excess demand is large.  It is shown that sellers will have an incentive to make ex ante offers when prices elsewhere are determined by Nash bargaining.  This can be interpreted to mean that Nash bargaining is an unstable pricing institution.

AB This paper analyzes a model of a dynamic monopolist who produces at constant unit cost.  Each period a new cohort of consumers enters the market.  Each entering cohort is identical.  Consumers within a cohort have different tastes for the good.  My main results are:  If players are sufficiently patient, any positive average profit less than the maximum feasible level can be attained in a subgame-perfect equilibrium; in the subset of subgame-perfect equilibria in which players use stationary strategies, the seller cannot make sales at prices significantly greater than the lowest willingness to pay when period length goes to zero; and the seller attains the maximum profit when commitment is feasible by charging the same (static monopoly) price in every period.
