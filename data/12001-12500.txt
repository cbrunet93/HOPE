TI FISCAL PARADISE - FOREIGN TAX HAVENS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID HOLIDAYS
AB The tax haven affiliates of American corporations account for more than 20 percent of U.S. foreign direct investment, and nearly a third of the foreign profits of U.S. firms. American companies report extraordinarily high profit rates on their tax haven investments in 1982. This behavior implies that the revenue-maximizing tax rate for a typical haven is around 5-8 percent. American (and foreign) investment in tax havens has an uncertain effect on U.S. tax revenue, but since low tax rates encourage American companies to shift profits out of high-tax foreign countries, it is possible that low foreign tax rates ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUSTRY; IMPACT; REFORM
AB When the responsibility for output decisions was shifted from the state to the firm, and when firms were allowed to retain more of their profits, managers of Chinese state-owned enterprises strengthened workers' incentives. The managers paid more in bonuses and hired more workers on fixed-term contracts. The new incentives were effective: productivity increased with increases in bonus payments and in contract workers. The increase in autonomy raised workers' incomes (but not managers' incomes) and investment in the enterprise, but tended not to raise remittances to the state.

TI LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND COLLUSION
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Private enforcement of regulatory policy is a significant feature of many government-sponsored contests, such as procurements. Although private enforcement is supposed to promote social welfare, we show that competitors can use it to achieve collusive outcomes. In a noncooperative duopoly setting, we show that the threat of litigation, and the possibility of settlement can dramatically affect ex ante competition in the relevant market. Essentially, the settlement process provides a legal mechanism for the exchange of side-payments, while the possibility of a court decision provides the plaintiff with a credible threat against the defendant so as to avert cheating. The result does not require repeated play, ex ante contracts, or other commitment devices. In the federal procurement context, we show that our results are robust to alterations in the court remedy, bargaining power of the litigants, and many other factors.

AB This paper uses two-variable autoregressions to characterize transitory components in GNP and stock prices. Shocks to GNP holding consumption constant are almost entirely transitory, and account for large fractions of the variance of GNP growth. If consumption does not change, consumers must think that any GNP change is transitory. The facts that the consumption/GNP ratio forecasts GNP growth and that consumption is nearly a random walk drive this result. An implication is that consumption provides a good estimate of the ''trend'' in GNP. Prices and dividends behave similarly: shocks to prices holding dividends constant are almost entirely transitory.

AB We present a framework for measuring the joint impact of labor unions on wages, employment, and days of work. Our particular application uses county level observations to measure the impact of unionism in West Virginia coal mining from 1897 to 1938. The widespread belief is that union-nonunion wage differentials in coal mining during this period were of the order of 50 percent or more. Our estimates are substantially less. We measure negligible differences in union-nonunion employment, while, in the 1920s, operating days in unionized mines were about 25 percent below those in nonunion mines.

AB Many researchers have employed ARCH models to estimate conditional variances and covariances. How successfully can ARCH models carry out this estimation when they are misspecified? This paper employs continuous record asymptotics to approximate the distribution of the measurement error. This allows us to (a) compare the efficiency of various ARCH models, (b) characterize the impact of different kinds of misspecification (e.g., ''fat-tailed'' errors, misspecified conditional means) on efficiency, and (c) characterize asymptotically optimal ARCH conditional variance estimates. We apply our results to derive optimal ARCH filters for three diffusion models, and to examine in detail the filtering properties of GARCH(1,1), AR(1) EGARCH, and the model of Taylor (1986) and Schwert (1989).

The class of estimators considered consists of estimators that can be defined as the solution to a minimization problem based on a criterion function that may depend on a preliminary infinite dimensional nuisance parameter estimator. The method of proof exploits results concerning the stochastic equicontinuity of stochastic processes. The results are applied to the problem of semiparametric weighted least squares estimation of partially parametric regression models. Primitive conditions are given for root T-consistency and asymptotic normality of this estimator.

AB This paper derives some exact finite sample distributions and characterizes the tail behavior of maximum likelihood estimators of the cointegrating coefficients in error correction models. It is shown that the reduced rank regression estimator has a distribution with Cauchy-like tails and no finite moments of integer order. The maximum likelihood estimator of the coefficients in a particular triangular system representation is studied and shown to have matrix t-distribution tails with finite integer moments to order T - n + r where T is the sample size, n is the total number of variables in the system, and r is the dimension of the cointegration space. These results help to explain some recent simulation studies where extreme outliers are found to occur more frequently for the reduced rank regression estimator than for alternative asymptotically efficient procedures that are based on the triangular representation. In a simple triangular system, the Wald statistic for testing linear hypotheses about the columns of the cointegrating matrix is shown to have an F distribution, analogous to Hotelling's T-2 distribution in multivariate linear regression.

AB In this paper I develop a practical extension of McFadden's method of simulated moments estimator for limited dependent variable models to the panel data case. The method is based on a factorization of the MSM first order condition into transition probabilities, along with the development of a new highly accurate method for similating these transition probabilities. A series of Monte-Carlo tests show that this MSM estimator performs quite well relative to quadrature-based ML estimators, even when large numbers of quadrature points are employed. The estimator also performs well relative to simulated ML, even when a highly accurate method is used to simulate the choice probabilities. In terms of computational speed, complex panel data models involving random effects and ARMA errors may be estimated via MSM in times similar to those necessary for estimation of simple random effects models via ML-quadrature.

AB This paper describes and analyzes movements of older men among labor force states using quarterly observations derived from the Retirement History Survey (RHS). A comparison of transition rates using these quarterly records with the more typical biannual records from the RHS and other sources reveals substantial undercounts in the binannual data, indicating that the prevalence of labor force movements at older ages has been underestimated previously. The quarterly data reveal a much sharper spike in the exit rate at exact age 65 than is found in data measured al less frequent intervals. Estimates are presented of the parameters of a reduced form model of labor force transitions. A novel feature of the model is the exploration of dynamic aspects of labor force behavior at older ages. The results show that labor force dynamics at older ages are important, including duration and spell occurrence dependence, and work experience effects. These effects are robust to nonparametric controls for unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates indicate that social security benefits have strong effects on the timing of labor force transitions at older ages, but that changes in social security benefit levels over time have not contributed much to the trend toward earlier labor force exit.

AB Using UK data the REPIH is rejected due to the predictive content of consumer confidence, and not labour income or any other macroeconomic variable. We provide evidence suggesting that this cannot be explained by liquidity constraints and account for this finding in terms of precautionary saving. Extending the CCAPM model to allow a time varying conditional variance we find a high level of confidence is associated with greater optimism about the level of consumption but also a higher forecast variance. Allowing for time aggregation, the overidentifying restrictions implied by this model are accepted. We estimate a small but statistically significant intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

AB The paper measures the cost of business cycles by asking what proportion of consumption representative households, whose head is currently employed, would be prepared to give up to avoid the risk of unemployment. Previous estimates by Lucas suggested that the costs of macroeconomic fluctuations measured in this way are surprisingly small. The first part of the paper presents a critique of the Lucas aggregate method showing that his estimates are not robust. An alternative disaggregated framework is then developed and shows that the costs of macroeconomic fluctuations are significantly higher than those obtained by Lucas. Consequently, the view that inflation 'matters' whereas business cycles are unimportant events is questioned.

We tested the Betweenness axiom, a weaker form of Independence, against an alternative which predicts that indifference curves in the probabilities simplex are convex along the lower edge and concave along the hypotenuse. We also checked whether preferences among single-stage lotteries, as those revealed by our test of Betweenness, should be extended to preferences among two-stage lottery via the classical Reduction of Compound Lottery axiom or via the Certainty Equivalent Mechanism.

ID EXPECTED UTILITY
AB An oddsmaker who does not update odds in accordance with conditional probability can be subjected to a sure loss. Such a losing situation is called a Dutch book. This is often presented as an argument for setting odds in accordance with conditional probability. We point out that if the strategic aspects of oddsmaking are taken into account (choice of odds is a strategic choice in games against bettors), then it is possible that in the equilibrium of the game, posted odds need not be updated 'correctly.' This calls into question the role of such arguments in the foundations of decision theory.

ID FUTURES MARKETS; RISK PREMIUMS; RETURNS; ABILITY; COSTS
AB This paper utilises transaction-specific data on forward trading in the international petroleum market to test directly predictions from the theory of normal backwardation against information-based predictions of trader performance. With the ability to identify buyers and sellers, we find that no traders make significant profits on interday measures. Within the day, however, traders likely to have superior information make significant profits. The results are not supportive of normal backwardation, but are consistent with the time pattern of information dissemination in this market - deals made during the day are widely reported only at day's end.

AB Many recent papers suggest that the basic flex-price target zone model does not perform well empirically. This paper investigates the testable implications of a sticky-price target zone model and finds that, to a limited extent, it has a better empirical performance than the simplest flex-price model. However (in terms of nominal variables) the sticky-price model is found to be observationally equivalent to the flex-price model when the latter is extended to include intra-marginal intervention and realignments.

ID VOLUNTARY EXPORT RESTRAINTS
AB This paper analyses the effects of an expected future voluntary export restraint on the level of firms' current exports to a market. The traditional result that current exports increase is shown to depend on the degree of collusion in the exporting industry and the anticipated restrictiveness of the VER. The former relationship is tested by reference to the effect of EC import surveillance on its imports. Surveillance is argued to indicate an increased probability of a VER in the future, and it is found that while competitive industries respond to it by increasing exports to the EC, less competitive ones curtail exports. This constitutes one of the few empirical tests of the strategic part of strategic trade policy.

ID OUTSIDERS
AB The ability of insiders to extract rents associated with exogenous turnover costs is addressed in a dynamic model. The higher these rents, the higher is the incentives for outsiders to obtain future insider status and thus to underbid current insiders. As a consequence there is a lower limit to the number of insiders which can avoid entrance of outsiders and the insiders cannot in each period obtain a rent equal to the turnover costs. The insider model never explains a lower but may result in a higher employment level than in the case where all workers are wage-takers.

AB Since the actual solution to intertemporal rational expectations models is usually not known, it is useful to have criteria for judging the accuracy of a given numerical solution. In this paper we propose a test for accuracy that is easy to implement and can be applied to a wide class of models without knowledge of the exact solution. We discuss the power of the test by simulating several models with the linear-quadratic approximation and with the method of parameterized expectations. We conclude that the test is powerful.

AB In this paper we argue that modelling the trend component in real GNP as a random walk is inconsistent with its interpretation as productivity growth. As an alternative, we specify the trend as an ARIMA whose impulse response function follows an S-shaped pattern reflecting the process of diffusion of technical change. Such an ARIMA is employed to build and estimate an UCARIMA using USA postwar quarterly data. We find that our model, although more parsimonious, fits the data equally well than the standard random walk plus AR(2) cycle. Moreover, our model has a very low cycle/trend variance ratio.

The cycles are generated by changes in information over time, as investors increase production and thus accumulate more information about demand. These are, therefore, informational cycles. The paper also shows that the frequency of cycles depends positively on profitability and negatively on the rate of interest.

TI MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION WITH ENDOGENOUS SPECIALIZATION
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INCREASING RETURNS
AB In the familiar spatial model of monopolistic competition on the circle, a product is identified by a single locational characteristic. representing its brand or variety. The ability of a variety to compete with other varieties a given distance away (its ''specialization'' as quantified by transportation losses or how rapidly the ''melting iceberg'' melts) is exogenously given in the standard model. Here, specialization is a choice variable selected by the firm. A monopolistically competitive general equilibrium is derived, where the degree of specialization is endogenously determined along with other variables. Implications are noted. The central contribution is to show that the effect of endogenizing specialization is to make the Hotelling-Lancaster Chamberlin model of monopolistic competition isomorphic to the analytically much more tractable Dixit-Stiglitz Ethier formulation, without sacrificing the appealing concept of product ''distance''.

AB The purpose of this paper is to estimate the parameters of household preferences that determine the allocation of goods within the period and over the life cycle, using micro data. In doing so we are able to identify important effects of demographics, labour market status and other household characteristics on the intertemporal allocation of expenditure. We test the validity of the life-cycle model using excess sensitivity tests and find that controlling for demographics and labour market status variables can largely explain the excess sensitivity of consumption to anticipated changes in income.

TI FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT AND THE RISK OF EXPROPRIATION
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; REPEATED GAMES; CONTRACTS; INTEGRATION
AB When an investor, for example a transnational corporation, invests abroad it runs the risk that its investment will be expropriated for the simple reason that international contracts are practically impossible to enforce. Any agreements or contracts then undertaken by the transnational company and the host country must be designed to be self-enforcing. It could be possible for the host country and the transnational corporation to find such self-enforcing agreements if there are future gains from trade. Thus although the host country might have a short-term incentive to expropriate, it has a long-term incentive to foster good relations with potential investors to attract more investment in the future. This conflict between short-term and long-term incentives determines the type of investment contracts agreed. This paper extends previous work on the general underprovision of investment when contracts are incomplete or only partially enforceable (see e.g. Grout (1984)) to a dynamic context. It is likewise shown that investment is initially underprovided but it increases over time and for certain parameter values it tends to the efficient level. The expected future discounted returns to the transnational company decline over time, extending Vernon's observation of the obsolescing bargain (Vernon (1971)). The model is also extended to allow for capital accumulation and consideration is given to renegotiation-proof contracts.

A refinement is imposed on the principal's beliefs: if precisely one action is optimal with respect to both the principal's and the agent's contracts, the principal believes that that action has been taken. With the refinement imposed, perfect-Bayesian equilibrium allocations are identical to the second best in the classical principal-agent model without renegotiation. When renegotiation is led by the agent and when equilibria satisfy the refinement, equilibrium allocations are ex ante efficient.

We show the equivalence between the Kyle (1985) model of insider trading where the insider observes the amount of noise trading and the Kyle (1989) model of informed speculation when there is one risk-neutral insider and many risk-neutral market makers. We show that in these two equivalent models: (i) There exists a unique equilibrium independently of the distribution of uncertainty; (ii) This equilibrium minimized the expected gains of the informed agent under incentive compatibility constraints.  We extend our results to a class of signalling games.

AB When market information such as price is difficult to communicate, consumers and firms may be unable to take advantage of mutually beneficial scale economies, so that coordination failures arise. Ostensibly uninformative advertising expenditures can be used to eliminate coordination failures, by allowing an efficient firm to communicate implicitly that it offers a low price. This provides a theoretical explanation for Benham's (1972) empirical association of the ability to advertise with lower prices and larger scale. Advertising becomes necessary for optimal coordination when the identity of the efficient firm is uncertain. An application to loss-leader pricing is developed.

AB In dynamic models of unemployment in which the employed consume more than the unemployed, workers are finitely lived, and jobs are lasting, employment transfers consumption from future generations to those currently alive, resulting in a social surplus. That is, these transfers allow the current generation to consume more than its share of the output produced during its lifetime, without the increased consumption coming at the expense of future generations. Moreover, due to these intergenerational transfers, the allocation that maximizes steady-state output is Pareto dominated by another feasible allocation with a higher level of steady-state employment.

AB Repeat sales of modem prints at auction are used to estimate a semiannual index of prices for the period 1977-1992. As in other studies of art as an investment, prints do not compare favorably to traditional financial assets. There is substantial noise in auction prices, but little or no support for the proposition that some artists command higher prices in certain countries or that masterpieces outperform the market. One puzzle is the continuing tendency for prices realized at certain auction houses to exceed those realized at others: notably, at Sotheby's relative to Christie's in New York.

ID FUTURES MARKETS; STOCK-PRICES; OCTOBER 1987; VOLATILITY; RISK
AB This paper argues that an important part of movements in asset prices may be caused by neither external news nor irrationality, but by the revelation of information by the trading process itself. Two models are developed that illustrate this general idea. One model is based on investor uncertainty about the quality of other investors' information; the other is based on widespread dispersion of information and small costs to trading. The analysis is used to suggest a possible rational explanation of the October 1987 crash.

ID AGENCY COSTS
AB This paper presents a strategic model of temporarily high leverage. When the repayment of senior claims depends in part upon further investment, shareholders may be able to alter credibly their incentives to invest through an exchange of junior debt for equity and thereby force concessions from senior creditors. We focus on the conflict between shareholders and risk-averse workers and show that this strategic use of debt leads to an inefficient allocation of risk. We characterize conditions under which firms will undergo leveraged recapitalizations, their choice of debt instruments, and the dynamics of their capital structure.

TI EFFICIENCY AND THE ROLE OF DEFAULT WHEN SECURITY MARKETS ARE INCOMPLETE
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that default plays an important positive role in the economy. If markets are incomplete and traders are only able to enter into contracts that they will be able to execute regardless of future events, contingent contracting may be severely restricted. Moreover, opening new markets may not relieve these restrictions. Default promotes efficiency in a way that opening new markets does not, by making it possible for traders to enter into contracts that they will be able to execute with high probability, but not with certainty.

TI REPUTATION AND DISCRETION IN FINANCIAL CONTRACTING
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

DT Article
ID INFORMATION
AB We explain the use of legally unenforceable, discretionary financial contracts in circumstances where legally enforceable contracts are feasible. A discretionary contract allows a contracting party to choose whether or not to honor the contract. It is shown that such a contract liquefies reputational capital by Permitting it to be depreciated in exchange for the preservation of financial capital and information reusability in financially impaired states. In addition, discretionary contracts foster the development of reputation. This explains discretion among highly confident letters, holding-company relationships, mutual-fund contracts, bank loan commitments, and other financial and nonfinancial contracts.

TI FACTOR SHARES AND SAVINGS IN ENDOGENOUS GROWTH
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-RUN GROWTH; INCREASING RETURNS; POLITICS
AB In models of steady investment-driven growth, an individual's propensity to save depends on how much of his income is drawn from accumulated factors of production (''capital'') rather than from nonaccumulated factors. When agents are heterogeneous in this respect, growth-oriented policies have distributional consequences, and in the absence of lump-sum redistribution, their implementation faces political constraints. If the median voter is capital-poor relative to the economy's representative agent, political interactions tend to slow down growth when policy acts on capital's income share and tend to accelerate it when investment subsidies are the policy instrument of choice.

ID CREDIBILITY
AB To explain the slow progress of mass privatization programs in eastern Europe, we present a model based on a positive spillover between aggregate privatization and the individual expected return to privatization, derived from a potential populist backlash if costly reforms do not bring forth sufficient aggregate privatization. The model allows for the simultaneous existence of a pessimistic zero-privatization trap and an optimistic full-privatization equilibrium defined by a critical mass of expected privatization. While both privatization subsidies and minimum-income guarantees can by themselves secure coordination on the optimistic equilibrium, the financing constraint may offset the direct effect.

ID PREEMPTION
AB Endogenous-growth theory suggests that technological change tends to reinforce the position of the leading nations. Yet sometimes this leadership role shifts. We suggest a mechanism that explains this pattern of ''leapfrogging'' as a response to occasional major changes in technology. When such a change occurs, the new technology does not initially seem to be an improvement for leading nations, given their extensive experience with older technologies. Lagging nations have less experience, the new technique allows them to use their lower wages to enter the market. If the new technique proves more productive than the old, leapfrogging of leadership occurs.

AB A key question concerning affirmative action is whether the labor-market gains it brings to minorities can continue without it becoming a permanent fixture in the labor market. We argue that this depends on how the policy affects employers' beliefs about the productivity of minority workers. We study the joint determination of employer beliefs and worker productivity in a model of statistical discrimination in job assignments. We prove that, even when identifiable groups are equally endowed ex ante, affirmative action can bring about a situation in which employers (correctly) perceive the groups to be unequally productive, ex post.

Respondents read scenarios describing a hypothetical company and its labor market, and recommended wage changes for several positions. Contrary to some popular theories, differences in unemployment, quit rates, and a company's return of assets led to almost no change in respondents' recommended wage increases. When market wages for closely related occupations diverged, most respondents did not recommend adjusting relative wages within the company; but when the occupations were not closely related (blue vs. white collar), most respondents recommended adjusting relative wages to reflect market forces.

AB This experiment factorially combined the major independent variables from Previous demand-game experiments (discount factors, outside options, termination probability, and first mover). Game-theoretic predictions were largely refuted by the data, and outcomes were often inefficient. Players without an outside option demanded more than predicted, and those with an option appeared to anticipate this behavior. Nonetheless, there was a positive relationship between differences in equilibrium predictions and differences in behavior. Bargainers appeared to focus on a minimally acceptable offer in making their demands and in considering the likelihood that the other party would accept their offer.

AB People like to help those who are helping them, and to hurt those who are hurting them. Outcomes reflecting such motivations are called fairness equilibria. Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other's material payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other's payoffs. It is shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered, and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored.

According to forward induction, choosing to play the game is a signal about intended action. Though the presence of the outside option changes play, we find only limited support for the forward-induction hypothesis. The effects of the outside option also reflect the creation of a focal point through the asymmetry created by offering the outside option to one of the two players.

This result is taken as evidence for alternative models that assume people experience some private benefit from contributing to public goods.

Similarly, the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theorem constitutes an incomplete description of trade in factor services: its predictions are always rejected empirically. These two issues are examined using a modification of the HOV model that allows for factor-augmenting international productivity differences. The empirical results are stark: this simple modification of the HOV theorem explains much of the factor content of trade and the cross-country variation in factor prices.

It differs from divorce threat bargaining models (e.g., Manser-Brown, McElroy-Horney) in that the threat point is not divorce but a noncooperative equilibrium within marriage; this noncooperative equilibrium reflects traditional gender roles. The predictions of our model thus differ from those of divorce threat bargaining models; in the separate spheres model, cash transfer payments to the mother and payments to the father can-but need not-imply different equilibrium distributions in existing marriages. In the long run, the distributional effects of transfer policies may be substantially altered by changes in the marriage market equilibrium.

The procedure begins by augmenting the variables in the model with just enough stochastic error so that the model can exactly match the second moments of the actual data. Measures of fit for the model can then be constructed on the basis of the size of this error. The procedure is applied to a standard real business cycle model. Over the business cycle frequencies, the model must be augmented with a substantial error to match data for the postwar U.S. economy. Lower bounds on the variance of the error range from 40 percent to 60 percent of the variance in the actual data.

AB This paper presents a class of models in which agents may devote part of their nonleisure activities to going to school so as to increase the efficiency units of labor they supply to the firms and the wages they receive. The interaction among the technology of human capital accumulation and agents' preferences will determine endogenously the economy's rate of growth. Given a constant returns to scale technology for physical capital accumulation, we characterize the set of steady states as a ray from the origin and show the global convergence of every off-balanced path to some point on this ray. Further properties concerning the dynamic evolution of the state and control variables around the ray of steady states are also established. Our analysis is useful to understand the role played by the technologies of physical and human capital in the process of accumulation and to evaluate the impact of policies geared toward attaining higher levels of capital. Our results highlight the importance of human capital in the dynamics of growth.

AB Milton Friedman has claimed that his monetary economics derives from a Chicago Tradition that, in the 1930s, offered a monetary explanation of cyclical fluctuations in general and the Great Depression in particular, an optimistic view of the power of monetary policy, and a case for governing it by rules rather than discretion. It is argued that all the elements of this tradition except the last are to be found in earlier writings of Ralph Hawtrey, Allyn Young, and Lauchlin Currie and that there is much evidence to point to a direct influence running from Hawtrey, through Harvard to Chicago.

ID PRECAUTIONARY SAVINGS; CONSUMPTION
AB Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, this paper presents a simple test that provides an explicit estimate of the parameter in the utility function that reflects the strength of the precautionary saving motive, the coefficient of relative prudence. The test yields a fairly precise estimate of a small precautionary motive; in fact, the estimate is too small to be consistent with widely accepted beliefs about risk aversion. The presence of liquidity-constrained households does not appear to explain this finding, and there is some evidence that self-selection of households into risky environments also cannot explain the results.

AB It is widely believed that rent control leads to a decline in the quality of rental housing. This study examines the effect of rent control on the quality of rental housing in New York City. Quality change is linked to the suppression of rent below market levels and other characteristics of the housing unit. We develop a first-order nonstationary, heterogeneous Markov model that allows for true state dependence, observed heterogeneity, nonparametric unobserved heterogeneity, and a mover-stayer structure. The results offer some support for the belief that rent control leads to a deterioration in housing quality but suggest the need for additional investigation of this issue.

AB The debate between the North and the South about the enforcement of intellectual property rights is examined within a dynamic general equilibrium framework in which the North invents new products and the South imitates them. A welfare evaluation of a policy of tighter intellectual property rights is provided by decomposing the welfare change into four items: (a) terms of trade; (b) production composition; (c) available products; and (d) intertemporal allocation of consumption. The paper provides a theoretical evaluation of the effect of each one of these items and their relative size. The analysis proceeds in stages. It begins with an exogenous rate of innovation in order to focus on the first two elements. The following two components are added by endogenizing the rate of innovation. Finally, the paper considers the role of foreign direct investment.

AB A dynamic model with many sellers and many buyers is constructed, in which buyers who fail to purchase in the current period may attempt to purchase in the future, and sellers who fail to sell may sell in the future. An equilibrium is found where sellers hold identical auctions and buyers randomize over the sellers they visit. Auctions alter the distribution of buyer types by removing high value buyers more rapidly than low value buyers, and an equilibrium distribution of buyer types is constructed. Sellers in equilibrium post an efficient reserve price equal to the sellers' value of the good, and an auction with efficient reserve is an optimal mechanism from each seller's point of view, in spite of the ability of any seller to alter the distribution of buyer types participating in the seller's mechanism by altering the mechanism.

ID INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL
AB Anecdotal and experimental evidence suggests that bargaining sessions subject to deadlines often begin with cheap talk and rejected proposals. Agreements, if they are reached at all, tend to be concluded near the deadline. We attempt to capture and explain these phenomena in a strategic bargaining model that incorporates a bargaining deadline, the possibility of strategic delay, and a lack of perfect player control over the timing of offers. Imperfect player control is generated by an exogenous uniformly-distributed random delay in offer transmission. Our model has a symmetric Markov-perfect equilibrium, unique at almost all nodes, in which players adopt strategic delay early in the game, make and reject offers later on, and reach agreements late in the game if at all. In equilibrium players miss the deadline with positive probability. The expected division of the surplus is unique and close to an even split.

We then consider a general class of procedures and show that there exists none in the class that is locally incentive compatible and individually rational. These results show that there exists a trade-off between the requirements of local incentive compatibility and equitable cost sharing.

For any fraction t and any Arrovian social welfare function f, either there will be some individual who dictates on a subset containing at least the fraction t of outcomes, or at least the fraction 1 - t of the ordered pairs of outcomes have their social ranking fixed independently of individual preference. If individual preferences are strong, we can say more: Associated with any Arrovian social welfare function, there is a set containing a large fraction of citizens whose preferences are not consulted in determining the social ranking of a large fraction of the pairs of alternatives.

AB This paper develops a limit theory for Wald tests of Granger causality in levels vector autoregressions (VAR's) and Johansen-type error correction models (ECM's), allowing for the presence of stochastic trends and cointegration. Earlier work by Sims, Stock, and Watson (1990) on trivariate VAR systems is extended to the general case, thereby formally characterizing the circumstances when these Wald tests are asymptotically valid as chi2 criteria. Our results for inference from unrestricted levels VAR are not encouraging. We show that without explicit information on the number of unit roots in the system and the rank of certain submatrices in the cointegration space it is impossible to determine the appropriate limit theory in advance; and, even when such information is available, the limit theory often involves both nuisance parameters and nonstandard distributions, a situation where there is no satisfactory statistical basis for mounting these tests.
   The situation with regard to the use of causality tests in ECM's is also complex but more encouraging. Granger causality tests in ECM's also suffer from nuisance parameter dependencies asymptotically and, in some cases that we make explicit, nonstandard limit theory. Both these results are somewhat surprising in the light of earlier research on the validity of asymptotic chi2 criteria in such systems. In spite of these difficulties, Johansen-type ECM's do offer a sound basis for empirical testing of the rank of the cointegration space and the rank of key submatrices that influence the asymptotics.

AB A system of consumer expenditure functions is estimated from Norwegian household budget data. Specific features of the approach are: (i) Panel data from individual households are used, which offer far richer opportunities for identification, estimation, and testing than cross section data. (ii) Measurement errors are carefully modelled. Total consumption expenditure is modelled as a latent variable; purchase expenditures on different goods and two income measures are used as indicators of this basic latent variable. The usual assumption of no measurement error in total expenditure is clearly rejected. (iii) The distribution of latent total expenditure across households, and its evolution over time, is estimated and important properties tested. (iv) The distribution of individual differences in preferences, represented by individual time invariant latent variables, are modelled, estimated, and tested. (v) We test the hypothesis that preferences are uncorrelated with total consumption expenditure, which is basic to virtually all cross section studies of consumer demand functions.

ID MONETARY-POLICY; DISCRETION; MONEY; MODEL; RULES; REPUTATION; DEMAND
AB Because unanticipated monetary expansion leads to real exchange rate depreciation, and because the harms of real depreciation are greater in more open economies, the benefits of unanticipated expansion are decreasing in the degree of openness. Models in which the absence of precommitment in monetary policy leads to excessive inflation therefore predict lower average inflation in more open economies. This paper tests this prediction using cross-country data. The data show a strong and robust negative link between openness and inflation.

DT Article
ID VOLATILITY; MARKETS; PRICES; MODEL; TIME
AB This paper investigates the relationship between aggregate stock market trading volume and the serial correlation of daily stock returns. For both stock indexes and individual large stocks, the first-order daily return autocorrelation tends to decline with volume. The paper explains this phenomenon using a model in which risk-averse ''market makers'' accommodate buying or selling pressure from ''liquidity'' or ''noninformational'' traders. Changing expected stock returns reward market makers for playing this role. The model implies that a stock price decline on a high-volume day is more likely than a stock price decline on a low-volume day to be associated with an increase in the expected stock return.

ID INFORMATION; PRICE
AB Our analysis treats advertisements and the goods advertised as complements in stable metautility functions, and generates new results for advertising by building on and extending the general analysis of complements. By assimilating the theory of advertising into the theory of complements, we avoid the special approaches to advertising found in many studies that place obstacles in the way of understanding the effects of advertising. We also use this approach to evaluate advertising from a welfare perspective. Whether there is excessive or too tittle advertising depends on several variables: the effects on consumer utility, the degree of competition in the market for advertised goods, the induced changes in prices and outputs of advertised goods, and whether advertising is sold to consumers.

AB The use of official funds in debt reduction packages has been widely argued to amount to a creditor bailout. We analyze this question using a case study of Mexico's 1989 Brady deal. Using an option-based pricing model, we obtain pre- and postmarket, values for Mexico's commercial debt and find that the market value inclusive or official funds went up only marginally. Consequently, Mexico obtained a large share of the benefits of the official funds and struck a favorable deal. The Brady debt reduction formula this seems to offer an efficient framework for debt workouts, Recent events in Mexico confirm that view.

ID WAGE DETERMINATION; REAL WAGE; EMPLOYMENT; CONTRACTS; FIRM
AB In this paper we estimate the effect of the financial conditions of firms on negotiated wage settlements and on employment using a sample of Canadian collective bargaining agreements from 1965 to 1983. We find that ordinary least squares estimates of the effect of quasi-rents per worker on wages are positive but very small. However, we find a much larger effect when we instrument quasi-rents with measures of foreign competition shocks. We conclude that standard estimates of rent-sharing based on contract data seriously understate the impact of product market competition on negotiated wage settlements.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT-INSURANCE; RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS; EMPLOYMENT; LAYOFFS
AB Standard models of dynamic labor demand rely on the presence of adjustment costs to explain the observed smoothness in employment patterns, although the costs are often difficult to quantify. The experience rating feature of the U. S. Unemployment Insurance (UI) system provides a measurable linear cost of adjustment. Using a unique data set with administrative data on over 8000 firms, I estimate the effect of a UI-induced linear adjustment cost on seasonal labor demand in retail trade. I find strong support for the large role of adjustment costs in reducing the employment response of firms to seasonal fluctuations in demand.

AB This paper investigates the Automobile Industry code negotiated in 1933 and modified in 1935 under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The amended code contained a provision calling for automobile producers to alter the timing of new model introductions and the annual automobile show as a means of regularizing employment in the industry. Our analysis of this period provides evidence against the hypothesis that changes in fundamentals led to the dramatic changes in the seasonal pattern of production and sales starting in 1935. Instead, it appears that the National Industrial Recovery Act succeeded in coordinating activity on an alternative Nash equilibrium.

ID DIVIDENDS; RETURNS
AB We test whether comovements of individual stock prices can be justified by economic fundamentals. This is a test of the present value model of security valuation with the constraint that changes in discount rates depend only on changes in macroeconomic variables. Then, stock prices of companies in unrelated lines of business should move together only in response to changes in current or expected future macroeconomic conditions. Using a latent variable model to capture unobserved expectations, we find excess comovement of returns. We show that this excess comovement can be explained in part by company size and degree of institutional ownership, suggesting market segmentation.

AB Two of the most discussed anomalies in the financial literature are the predictability of excess returns and the excess volatility of stock prices. Learning effects on stock price dynamics are an intuitive candidate to explain these empirical findings: estimation uncertainty may increase volatility of stock prices and an estimate of the dividend growth rate that is, say, lower than the ''true'' value tends to increase the dividend yield and capital gain. Simulations of learning effects in a present value model confirm that learning may help to explain excess volatility and predictability of stock returns.

AB Trade is sequential:  Buyers arrive in batches, and each batch completes trade before the next arrives.  Producers allocate the available supply among all potential batches of buyers.  Inventories accumulate whenever a batch does not arrive.  Shocks to cost and demand are serially independent. There, is a stationary relationship between inventories and prices with the following properties.  Larger beginning-of-period inventories tend to depress prices.  Inventories are positively serially correlated.  A unit increase in inventories reduces output by less than one unit.  An increase in inventories leads to an increase in the price spread.  Output tends to vary more than sales.

ID ACCOUNTANTS
AB There has been an enormous increase in auditing and accounting standards and in litigation against auditors.  This paper examines some of the consequences of these changes by developing a model of the audit market relating auditors' liability to auditing standards. The paper demonstrates how equilibrium audit fees depend on both the informational value of the audit and the option value of the claim financial statement users have on the auditor's wealth in the event the audit is determined to have been substandard.  Auditors' attitudes toward and responses to auditing standards are studied, and characteristics of optimal liability rules are evaluated.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIVISIBLE LABOR; EMPLOYMENT
AB Recent empirical work indicates that job creation and destruction rates are large, implying significant amounts of job reallocation across firms. This paper builds a general equilibrium model of this reallocation process, calibrates it using data on firm-level dynamics, and evaluates the aggregate implications of policies that interfere with this process. We find that a tax on job destruction at the firm level has a sizable negative impact on total employment: a tax equal to 1 year's wages reduces employment by roughly 2.5 percent. More striking, however, are the welfare consequences: the cost in terms of consumption of this same tax is greater than 2 percent. The mechanism through which this welfare loss arises is apparently a decrease in average productivity, since this policy results in a decrease in average productivity of over 2 percent.

TI POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM, INCOME-DISTRIBUTION, AND GROWTH
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the impact of income distribution on growth when investment in human capital is the source of growth and individuals vote over the degree of redistribution in the economy. The model has three main features. First, very different patterns of income distribution are conducive to high growth at different levels of per capita income. Second, growth is associated with an externality whereby investment in human capital by one group increases the productivity of other groups, thus potentially enabling them to invest in human capital. Third, the initial pattern of income distribution and the resulting political equilibrium are crucial in determining whether the transmission of this externality is promoted, in which case growth is enhanced, or prevented, in which case growth is stopped.
   Using a non-overlapping generations model with voting, I derive several empirical implications. In particular, the model implies an inverted-U relation between levels of inequality and levels of income in cross-sections, but not necessarily in time series, a result that seems consistent with a number of empirical studies.

AB The possibility of sunspot equilibria and endogenous cycles are explored in a two-sector overlapping-generations model with entry. It is shown that if prospective entrants act oligopolistically as producers but competitively as consumers then a strategic complementarity between the entry decisions of agents across sectors and across time may arise. If the complementarity is sufficiently strong, the economy will have multiple, Pareto-ranked steady states. Stationary sunspot equilibria can then be constructed as a randomization between allocations in the neighbourhood of the multiple steady states providing a source of aggregate fluctuations.

AB Are stock prices determined by fundamentals or can ''bubbles'' exist'' An important issue in this debate concerns the circumstances in which deviations from fundamentals are consistent with rational behaviour. When there is asymmetric information between investors and portfolio managers, portfolio managers have an incentive to churn; their trades are not motivated by changes in information, liquidity needs or risk sharing but rather by a desire to profit at the expense of the investors that hire them. As a result, assets can trade at prices which do not reflect their fundamentals and bubbles can exist.

Their support is infinite with two accumulation points (steady states); the stochastic motion of the system is of random-walk type. A general strategy for an existence proof-associated with the study of a dynamical system-stresses necessary conditions. In a simple overlapping-generations model, the proof is made complete-no backwards bending labour supply is required in the pure sunspot case.  By continuity, heteroclinic random walk equilibria are also shown to exist when shocks are real.

AB We develop a theory of general equilibrium with endogenous debt limits in the form of individual rationality constraints similar to those in the dynamic consistency literature. If an agent defaults on a contract, he can be excluded from future contingent claims markets trading and can have his assets seized. He cannot be excluded from spot markets trading, however, and he has some private endowments that cannot be seized. All information is publicly held and common knowledge, and there is a complete set of contingent claims markets. Since there is complete information, an agent cannot enter into a contract in which he would have an incentive to default in some state. In general there is only partial insurance: variations in consumption may be imperfectly correlated across agents; interest rates may be lower than they would be without constraints; and equilibria may be Pareto ranked.

It shows that in an inflationary environment, an expansionary monetary shock is accommodated faster than a contractionary monetary shock. Furthermore, when the average rate of monetary expansion increases, the lag in response to a positive shock decreases. The study also proves that the relationship between the expected rate of inflation and the variance of real prices is positive only above a critical level of expected inflation.

AB This paper develops a methodology for estimating structural time-allocation models for self-employed households and applies it to peasant family labour supply behaviour in the Peruvian Sierra. The opportunity costs of time, or shadow wages, of household workers are explicitly estimated from an agricultural production function. Using an instrumental variables procedure, the household's structural labour supply parameters are recovered from variation in these shadow wages. The empirical results are robust to a number of alternative specifications and diagnostic tests and lend support to the rational allocation of time by peasant households.

Conditions called diagonal transfer quasiconcavity and uniform transfer quasiconcavity are shown to be necessary and, with conditions called diagonal transfer continuity and transfer upper semicontinuity, sufficient for the existence of pure-strategy and dominant-strategy Nash equilibrium, respectively. The results are used to examine the existence or non-existence of equilibrium in some well-known economic games with discontinuous and/or non-quasiconcave payoffs. For example, we show that the failure of the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the Hotelling model is due to the failure of an aggregator function to be diagonal transfer quasiconcave-not the failure of payoffs to be quasiconcave, as has been elsewhere conjectured.

Conditions called transfer FS-convexity and transfer SS-convexity are shown to be necessary and, in conjunction with transfer closedness and transfer openness, sufficient for the existence of greatest and maximal elements of weak and strict preferences, respectively. The results require neither the continuity nor convexity of preferences, and are valid for both ordered and unordered binary relations. Thus, the results generalize almost all of the theorems on existence of maximal elements of preferences that appear in the literature.

This paper uses a structural vector autoregression estimated on ante- and postbellum data to distinguish the influences of changes in the nature or magnitude of the disturbances from those of changes in the response of the system to shocks (i.e., changes in structure) in contributing to this increased economic instability. The increased cyclical severity in the postbellum period is found to have been the result of greater sensitivity to monetary disturbances, rather than of larger or more volatile shocks.

AB Wage, price, and output indexes suitable for comparing cyclical movements across decades show a decrease in nominal wage flexibility (the change in wage inflation associated with output fluctuations) after the 1880's, following an increase in strike frequency linked to the spread of large-scale manufacturing. Cross-sectional data show that firms in industries experiencing more strikes in the 1880's were less likely to cut nominal wages in the depression of 1893. This and other evidence suggests that the 19th-century decrease in wage flexibility was caused by an increase in workers' bargaining power in the absence of binding wage contracts.

I illustrate that the incentive to conform implies inefficiencies, even when workers are risk-neutral, and is likely to lead to more centralized decision-making than in the absence of the desire to conform.

TI PROMOTION, TURNOVER, AND PREEMPTIVE WAGE OFFERS
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID JOB
AB This paper examines the strategic promotion and wage decisions of employers when employees may be more valuable to competing firms. Competing employers must incur a cost to learn the quality of their match with a manager. Promotion signals that workers are potentially valuable managers in other firms and so can lead to turnover. To preempt competition for a manager, an employer may offer a wage high enough to discourage competitors from acquiring information and bidding up the wage further or hiring the worker away. This transfers wages from good workers to bad. More costly information acquisition yields greater expected lifetime wages.

TI THE ECONOMICS OF ROTATING SAVINGS AND CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the economic role and performance of a type of financial institution which is observed worldwide: rotating savings and credit associations (Roscas). Using a model in which individuals save for an indivisible durable consumption good, we study Roscas which distribute funds using random allocation and bidding. Each type of Rosca allows individuals without access to credit markets to improve their welfare, but under a reasonable assumption on preferences, random allocation is preferred when individuals have identical tastes. This conclusion need not hold when individuals are heterogeneous. We also discuss the sustainability of Roscas given the possibility of default.

AB We analyze incomplete contracts to induce efficient investment. With exogenous switching costs, fixed-price contracts are efficient, generate some rigidity in prices, are renegotiated intermittently by possibly small amounts, and when inflation is positive, generate asymmetric responses to shocks, all consistent with evidence on prices and wages. With two-sided specific investments, efficiency requires prices to have sufficient escalator clauses to avoid renegotiation, as observed in many long-term contracts. A third case, with one-sided specific investments, can generate ''take or pay'' contracts and explain why firms sometimes pay for specific investments that appear to benefit employees directly.

AB Two popular selling methods - posted-price selling and auctions - are compared here in an independent private-values model. Without auctioning costs, auctioning is always optimal. When auctioning is costly, auctions are still preferable if the marginal-revenue curve is sufficiently steep. The global steepness of the marginal-revenue curve is found to coincide with the dispersion around the mean for a number of standard distributions. Finally, the prices of the monopoly seller and of the social optimum are compared.

AB We examine paternalism as an implicit contract in which workers trade faithful service for nonmarket goods. Paternalism reduced monitoring and turnover costs in cotton cultivation in the U.S. South until the mechanization of the cotton harvest in the 1950's. Until then, the effectiveness of paternalism was threatened by government programs that could have substituted for paternalism; but large Southern landowners had the political power to prevent the appearance of such programs in the South. With mechanization, the economic incentive to provide paternalism disappeared, and Southern congressmen allowed welfare programs to expand in ways consistent with their interests. 033, P16)

ID FISCAL COMPETITION; HARMONIZATION; EQUILIBRIUM; TAXATION; STATES
AB Closer international integration is putting increasing pressure on existing national tax structures. This paper uses a simple two-country model to address a range of consequent policy concerns, focusing particularly on the role of country size. Differences in size exacerbate the inefficiency from noncooperative behavior, harming both countries. The smaller country loses from harmonization to any tax rate between those set in the noncooperative equilibrium, but both countries gain from the imposition of a minimum tax anywhere in that range. The fully optimal response to freer cross-border trade, however, may be to do nothing.

Over the life cycle, older individuals have higher wages, more hours worked both in the market and at home, a lower variance of market hours, and almost the same amount of education as younger agents. These and other facts are documented, and a simple overlapping-generations model with skill acquisition and home production which delivers most of these properties is constructed.

AB Neoclassical transitional dynamics are a central element of standard macroeconomic theory. Quantitative experiments with the fixed-savings-rate models of the 1960's showed lengthy transitions, thus potentially rationalizing sustained differences in growth rates across countries. We investigate quantitative transitional dynamics in various neoclassical models with intertemporally optimizing households. Lengthy transitions occur only with very low intertemporal substitution. Generally, when one tries to explain sustained economic growth with transitional dynamics, there are extremely counterfactual implications. These result from the fact that implied marginal products are extraordinarily high in the early stages of development.

AB This paper examines economy-wide and sector-specific responses of real wages to nominal shocks using micro panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men. The observed response patterns provide no support for nominal-contracting theories of unemployment, which predict that nominal surprises should be negatively correlated with real wages. In fact, both inflation and money-growth surprises are found to be essentially uncorrelated with real wages. Either a real-business-cycle model or a model with rigidities in commodity prices could be consistent with these results.

TI GOVERNMENT REVENUE FROM FINANCIAL REPRESSION
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

DT Article
AB This paper provides empirical evidence on the effects of financial repression on government finances. Financial repression is a combination of controls on international capital flows with restrictions on domestic interest rates. The result is an artificially low cost of domestic funding to governments. We estimate the government revenue from financial repression as the difference between the foreign and the domestic cost of funds, times the domestic stock of government debt. The evidence indicates that the revenue from financial repression can be quite substantial, and for several countries it is of the same order of magnitude as seigniorage.

AB Each of n players, in an infinitely repeated game, starts with subjective beliefs about his opponents' strategies. If the individual beliefs are compatible with the true strategies chosen, then Bayesian updating will lead in the long run to accurate prediction of the future play of the game. It follows that individual players, who know their own payoff matrices and choose strategies to maximize their expected utility, must eventually play according to a Nash equilibrium of the repeated game. An immediate corollary is that, when playing a Harsanyi-Nash equilibrium of a repeated game of incomplete information about opponents' payoff matrices, players will eventually play a Nash equilibrium of the real game, as if they had complete information.

DE LEARNING; NEIGHBORS; COORDINATION; RATES OF CONVERGENCE
AB This paper discusses the dynamic implications of learning in a large population coordination game, focusing on the structure of the matching process which describes how players meet. As in Kandori, Mailath, and Rob (1993) a combination of experimentation and myopia creates ''evolutionary'' forces which lead players to coordinate on the risk dominant equilibrium. To describe play with finite time horizons it is necessary to consider the rates at which the dynamic systems converge. In large populations with uniform matching, play is determined largely by historical factors. In contrast, when players interact with small sets of neighbors it is more reasonable to assume that evolutionary forces may determine the outcome.

AB We design and study an OLG experimental economy where the government finances a fixed real deficit through seigniorage. The economy has continua of nonstationary rational expectations equilibria and two stationary rational expectations equilibria. We do not observe nonstationary rational expectations paths. Observed paths tend to converge close to, or somewhat below, the low inflation stationary state (low ISS). The adaptive learning hypothesis is consistent with our data in selecting the low ISS rational expectations equilibrium as a long-run stationary equilibrium. Nevertheless, simple adaptive learning models do not capture the market uncertainty or the biases observed in the data.

I characterize efficient networks for both one-shot and repeated regimes, as well as the corresponding ''production function'' relating the number of items processed to the number of processors and the delay. I sketch some applications to common decision paradigms, and implications for decentralization and organizational returns to scale.

AB It is shown that any informationally decentralized mechanism that realizes fair allocations over the class of classical pure exchange environments has a message space of dimension no smaller than the number of agents times the number of commodities. Since the equal income Walrasian mechanism, in which all agents take prices parametrically and maximize utility subject to the average income constraint, realizes fair outcomes over the class of classical pure exchange environments and has a message space of that dimension it is informationally efficient. Further, it is shown that it is the unique informationally efficient mechanism realizing fair allocations.

   MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION; NONNESTED MODEL SPECIFICATION TEST
ID BURKINA-FASO; DETERMINANTS
AB This paper reports estimates of the structural parameters of a stochastic control model that describes the labor decisions of small farmers in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The focus of the estimation is on measuring flexibility in production and intertemporal substitutability in consumption. Full information maximum likelihood estimates of the primitive parameters of the model are computed even though optimal labor decision rules cannot be derived analytically. Vuong's non-nested model specification test shows that this method yields parameter estimates that are superior to those derived by assuming that farmers solve a deterministic control problem.
   The low levels of agricultural labor effort commonly observed in the survey area are shown to be a consequence both of the low productivity of labor in archaic rainfed agriculture and of farmers' awareness that, in the absence of a labor market, overly ambitious production plans lead to seasonal manpower constraints. To meet rainfed farmers' concerns, agricultural research institutes and extension services should factor flexibility into their research agendas.

ID COEFFICIENTS
AB Weighted average derivatives are useful parameters for semiparametric index models and nonparametric demand analysis. This paper gives efficiency results for average derivative estimators, including formulating estimators that have high efficiency.
   Our analysis is carried out in three steps. First, we derive the efficiency bound for weighted average derivatives of conditional location functionals, such as the conditional mean and median. Second, we derive the efficiency bound for semiparametric index models, where the location measure depends only on indices, or linear combinations of the regressors. Third, we compare the bound for index models with the asymptotic variance of weighted average derivative estimators of the index coefficients.
   We characterize the form of the optimal weight function when the distribution of the regressors is elliptically symmetric. In more general cases, we discuss how to combine estimators with different weight functions to achieve efficiency. We derive a general condition for approximate efficiency of pooled (minimum chi square) estimators for index model coefficients, based on weighted average derivatives. Finally, we discuss ways of selecting the type and number of weighting functions to achieve high efficiency.

TI PRICE SUPPORT, ACREAGE CONTROLS, AND EFFICIENT REDISTRIBUTION
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; COMMODITY
AB This study is concerned with the combination of target price and acreage controls as the two major mechanisms of farm policy. Acreage controls are shown to enhance the efficiency of redistribution under a target price program. More specifically, this study demonstrates that if the traditional Cobb-Douglas production function is, assumed, acreage controls do not enhance the efficiency of target price programs in the process of redistributing income to the farm sector. The study proves that if the elasticity of substitution between land and all other inputs is less than one, then the income redistributional costs are likely to be reduced. Moreover, by using an empirical estimate of the elasticity of substitution and farm data for the time period 1984-88, this study demonstrates that acreage control programs have drastically reduced the deadweight losses associated with income redistribution flowing from target price programs. These results lend strong support to the public choice notion that politicians favor efficient redistribution schemes.

AB This paper studies agents who consider the experiences of their neighbors in deciding which of two technologies to use. We analyze two learning environments, one in which the same technology is optimal for all players and another in which each technology is better for some of them. In both environments, players use exogenously specified rules of thumb that ignore historical data but may incorporate a tendency to use the more popular technology. In some cases these naive rules can lead to fairly efficient decisions in the long run, but adjustment can be slow when a superior technology is first introduced.

AB This paper presents an empirical investigation of adverse selection in the wholesale used car market. New car dealers (who sell both new and used cars) differ from used car dealers (who sell only used cars) in the propensity to sell trade-ins on the wholesale market. Models of adverse selection suggest that the dealer type that sells a higher proportion of its trade-ins on the wholesale market will sell, on average, cars of higher quality and receive in return a higher price. A survey of dealers' wholesale behavior and prices collected at a wholesale auction are used to test this prediction. I find weak evidence for adverse selection.

AB Dowries in South Asia have steadily risen over the last 40 years and now often amount to over 50 percent of a household's assets. This paper attempts to investigate the reasons behind this increase. It adapts Rosen's implicit market model to the Indian marriage market and tests predictions from the model with data from six villages in South Central India and from the Indian census. It is found that a ''marriage squeeze'' caused by population growth, resulting in larger younger cohorts and hence a surplus of women in the marriage market, has played a significant role in the rise in dowries.

AB This paper studies the value of the stock market as a monitor of managerial performance. It shows that the stock price incorporates performance information that cannot be extracted from the firm's current or future profit data. The additional information is useful for structuring managerial incentives. The amount of information contained in the stock price depends on the liquidity of the market. Concentrated ownership, by reducing market liquidity, reduces the benefits of market monitoring. Integration is associated with weakened managerial incentives and less market monitoring. This may explain why shares of divisions of a firm are rarely traded. The model offers a reason why market liquidity and monitoring have both a private and a social value, a feature missing in standard finance models. This is used to study the equilibrium size of the stock market as a function of investor preferences and the available amounts of long- and short-term capital.

ID INEQUALITY; EDUCATION; MARRIAGE; QUALITY; AGE
AB We investigate whether omitted family background variables are responsible for high returns to schooling estimated in Brazil. Returns to schooling fall by about one-third when parental schooling is added to wage equations. Surprisingly, the schooling of fathers-in-law has larger effects on wages than the schooling of fathers. On the basis of a model of assortative mating we interpret this as evidence that parental characteristics represent unobservable worker attributes rather than nepotism in the labor market. We conclude that the ''family background bias'' in returns to schooling is modest and need not imply returns to family connections.

In a survey of 25 cases filed between 1973 and 1984, prices are found to gradually rise by about 7 percent over the 4 years following an indictment. However, the severity of penalties is negatively correlated with prices. These two findings suggest either that penalties are too lenient or that prosecution is too broad, penalizing economically efficient conspiracies along with those that are inefficient.

AB This paper proposes a production function describing processes subject to mistakes in any of several tasks. It shows that high-skill workers-those who make few mistakes-will be matched together in equilibrium, and that wages and output will rise steeply in skill. The model is consistent with large income differences between countries, the predominance of small firms in poor countries, and the positive correlation between the wages of workers in different occupations within enterprises. Imperfect observability of skill leads to imperfect matching and thus to spillovers, strategic complementarity, and multiple equilibria in education.

AB We compare the geographic location of patent citations with that of the cited patents, as evidence of the extent to which knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. We find that citations to domestic patents are more likely to be domestic, and more likely to come from the same state and SMSA as the cited patents, compared with a ''control frequency'' reflecting the pre-existing concentration of related research activity. These effects are particularly significant at the local (SMSA) level. Localization fades over time, but only very slowly. There is no evidence that more ''basic'' inventions diffuse more rapidly than others.

In particular, weak governments that do not control their agencies experience very high corruption levels. Second, the illegality of corruption and the need for secrecy make it much more distortionary and costly than its sister activity, taxation. These results may explain why, in some less developed countries, corruption is so high and so costly to development.

Local complementarities in human capital investment induce occupational segregation, although efficiency may require identical communities. Even when some asymmetry is optimal, equilibrium segregation can cause entire ''ghettos'' to drop out of the labor force. Underemployment is more extensive, the easier it is for high-skill workers to isolate themselves from others. When perfect segregation is feasible, individual incentives to pursue it are self-defeating and lead instead to a collapse of the productive sector.

This paper constructs and empirically tests a model of long-run world population growth combining this implication with the Malthusian assumption that technology limits population. The model predicts that over most of history, the growth rate of population will be proportional to its level. Empirical tests support this prediction and show that historically, among societies with no possibility for technological contact, those with larger initial populations have had faster technological change and population growth.

AB We analyze the steady state and transitional dynamics of two-sector models of endogenous growth. The necessary conditions for endogenous growth imply that transitions depend only on a measure of the imbalance between the two sectors such as the ratio of the two capital stocks. We use the Time-Elimination method to analyze the transitional dynamics. Three main economic forces drive the transition: a Solow effect, a consumption smoothing effect, and a relative wage effect. For plausible parameterizations the consumption smoothing effect tends to dominate the relative wage effect; transition from relatively low levels of physical capital is accomplished through higher work effort rather than higher savings.

AB The influence of Schumpeter's notion of ''creative destruction'' may have led to an overemphasis on substitution between technologies in recent models of endogenous innovation. Historical examples of technological change suggest that new technologies may just as frequently complement older technologies, creating, rather than destroying, rents. Acknowledgment of the potential for both substitution and complementarity among inventions allows for a much richer characterization of the growth process, creating the possibility of threshold effects and multiple equilibria and bringing to the forefront the important role played by the expectations of inventive entrepreneurs.

DT Article
AB First, production functions are estimated for China's aggregate economy and for the five sectors-agriculture, industry, construction, transportation, and commerce-using annual data (some constructed by the author) from 1952 to 1980. Then, this paper measures the contribution of capital formation to the growth of these sectors, the effects of the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1962 and of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 on outputs, the impact of economic reforms since 1979 on growth, the rates of return to capital, and the effects of sectorial growths on relative prices.

AB When will an industry subject to agglomeration economies move from an old, high-cost site to a new, low-cost site? It is argued that history, in the form of sunk costs resulting from the operation of many firms at a site, creates a first-mover disadvantage that can prevent relocation. It is demonstrated that developers of industrial parks can partly overcome this inertia through discriminatory pricing of land over time, and empirical evidence is provided that they actually engage in such behavior. It is also shown that other aspects of developer land-sale strategy can be a source of information on the nature of interfirm externalities.

AB This paper examines how the possibility of renegotiation affects contractual outcomes in environments in which adverse selection is a problem. The game setup is an extension of the one-shot signalling game in which an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation are permitted before contracted actions are in fact executed. The main results of the paper are (1) executed contracts may still contain distortions although players can never commit not to renegotiate, (2) the popular ''efficient'' separating-equilibrium outcome of one-shot signalling games is never an equilibrium outcome when an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation are permitted, (3) standard incentive-compatibility constraints can be easily generalized to incorporate situations that allow for an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation, (4) equilibrium outcomes can be separating and nevertheless depend on the uninformed player's priors as informed types pool in the first stage and use the renegotiation stages to separate, (5) renegotiation in signalling games may lead to outcomes similar to equilibrium outcomes of screening games in which multiple contract purchases are allowed.

AB Efficient estimators of cointegrating vectors are presented for systems involving deterministic components and variables of differing, higher orders of integration. The estimators are computed using GLS or OLS, and Wald Statistics constructed from these estimators have asymptotic chi2 distributions. These and previously proposed estimators of cointegrating vectors are used to study long-run U.S. money (M1) demand. M1 demand is found to be stable over 1900-1989; the 95% confidence intervals for the income elasticity and interest rate semielasticity are (.88, 1.06) and (-.13, -.08), respectively. Estimates based on the postwar data alone, however, are unstable, with variances which indicate substantial sampling uncertainty.

AB This paper considers tests for parameter instability and structural change with unknown change point. The results apply to a wide class of parametric models that are suitable for estimation by generalized method of moments procedures. The paper considers Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood ratio-like tests. Each test implicitly uses an estimate of a change point. The change point may be completely unknown or it may be known to lie in a restricted interval. Tests of both '' pure'' and '' partial'' structural change are discussed.
   The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics considered here are nonstandard because the change point parameter only appears under the alternative hypothesis and not under the null. The asymptotic null distributions are found to be given by the supremum of the square of a standardized tied-down Bessel process of order p greater-than-or-equal-to 1, as in D. L. Hawkins (1987). Tables of critical values are provided based on this asymptotic null distribution.
   As tests of parameter instability, the tests considered here are shown to have nontrivial asymptotic local power against all alternatives for which the parameters are nonconstant. As tests of one-time structural change, the tests are shown to have some weak asymptotic local power optimality properties for large sample size and small significance level. The tests are found to perform quite well in a Monte Carlo experiment reported elsewhere.

Computed covariances would be used to test linear restrictions on sets of impulse responses, step responses, or variance decompositions. The results unify and extend previous formulas to handle any model in VARMA form, provide accurate computations based on analytic derivatives, and provide insights into the structures of the asymptotic covariances.

AB The paper develops an approach for analyzing the dynamics of a nonlinear time series that is represented by a nonparametric estimate of its one-step ahead conditional density. The approach entails examination of conditional moment profiles corresponding to certain shocks; a conditional moment profile is the conditional expectation evaluated at time t of a time invariant function evaluated at time t + j regarded as a function of j. Comparing the conditional moment profiles to baseline profiles is the nonlinear analog of conventional impulse-response analysis. The approach includes strategies for laying out realistic perturbation experiments in multivariate situations and for undertaking statistical inference using bootstrap methods. It also includes examination of profile bundles for evidence of damping or persistence. The empirical work investigates a bivariate series comprised of daily changes in the Standard and Poor's composite price index and daily NYSE transactions volume from 1928 to 1987. The effort uncovers evidence showing the heavily damped character of the ''leverage effect'' and the differential response (short-term increase, long-term decline) of trading volume to ''common-knowledge'' price shocks.

AB We derive low frequency, say weekly, models implied by high frequency, say daily, ARMA models with symmetric GARCH errors. Both stock and flow variable cases are considered. We show that low frequency models exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity of the GARCH form as well. The parameters in the conditional variance equation of the low frequency model depend upon mean, variance, and kurtosis parameters of the corresponding high frequency model. Moreover, strongly consistent estimators of the parameters in the high frequency model can be derived from low frequency data in many interesting cases. The common assumption in applications that rescaled innovations are independent is disputable, since it depends upon the available data frequency.

ID JOB-SEARCH MODEL; FERTILITY
AB This paper develops a new method for estimating the structural parameters of (discrete choice) dynamic programming problems. The method reduces the computational burden of estimating such models. We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators. To illustrate our new method, we estimate a dynamic model of parental contraceptive choice and fertility using data from the National Fertility Survey.

AB This paper examines the reflection problem that arises when a researcher observing the distribution of behaviour in a population tries to infer whether the average behaviour in some group influences the behaviour of the individuals that comprise the group. It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the composition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to impossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.

   TEND TO INCREASE OR DECREASE
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUSTRY EVOLUTION; INNOVATION; COMPETITION; UNCERTAINTY; RACES
AB This paper is an attempt to identify some of the factors that affect the evolution of market structure in a model of dynamic competition between two firms. The stochastic evolution of the state of competition depends on the respective effort rates of the firms. The question is whether the current leader works harder than the laggard-does the 'gap' between firms tend to increase or decrease? We show that several effects are at work. The state tends to evolve in the direction where joint payoffs are greater. Since joint payoffs are related to joint product-market profits less joint effort costs, there are two classes of effect: the joint-profit effect and various joint-cost effects. The latter result in part from the pattern of profits, and in part from endpoint effects that give relief from efforts. Asymptotic expansions illuminate these influences. Moreover, we show by numerical simulation that there is another kind of joint-cost effect. The pattern of joint effort costs can influence the pattern of evolution of market structure, and the evolution of the pattern of market structure can influence the pattern of efforts, in a mutually self-reinforcing manner. In particular, there may be equilibria in which this last effect means that the laggard works harder than the leader even though all the other effects work in favour of the leader.

TI WARRANTIES, DURABILITY, AND MAINTENANCE - 2-SIDED MORAL HAZARD IN A
   CONTINUOUS-TIME MODEL
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

ID PRODUCT QUALITY
AB Double moral hazard in continuous time generates the familiar warranty pattern with full coverage for an initial block of time. The more complete the warranty, the better the producer's durability incentives and the worse the consumer's maintenance incentives. Using continuous time highlights the need for some warranty bound to avoid reaching the first-best as an unreasonable limit. Early in the paper, an exogenous bound is used, while later the bound arises endogenously from the possibility of abuse and repair. A quadratic example shows that the warranty's duration depends on the relative severity of the two moral hazard problems.

ID MORAL HAZARD; TEAMS
AB This paper shows in two ways that the degree to which free-riding diminishes the performance of deterministic partnerships may be less than has been generally thought. First, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided for a partnership to sustain full efficiency. It implies that many non-trivial partnerships sustain efficiency, such as generic ones with finite action spaces, and neoclassical ones with Leontief technologies. Second, approximate efficiency is shown to be achievable in a large class of partnerships, including ones with smooth and monotonic production and disutility functions. Approximate efficiency is achieved by mixed-strategy equilibria: one partner takes, with small probability, an inefficient action. The degree to which efficiency is approximated is restricted only by the amount of liability the partners can bear. Nonetheless, their equilibrium payments are not arbitrarily large.

AB We study a general implementation problem for exchange economies with a continuum of players and private information, and test the robustness of the results for sequences of approximating finite economies. Assuming that the designer knows the distribution of the characteristics in the economy we consider continuous and unique implementation in both its equilibrium and dominant strategies versions and obtain results for general self-selective (first- and second-best) allocations. An upper hemicontinuity property of Bayesian equilibria of approximating economies for continuous mechanisms is demonstrated. Using this, we can, for example, conclude that if a given continuous mechanism implements uniquely a Walrasian allocation in the continuum economy then all Bayesian equilibria of large approximation economies will (with probability close to one) yield an allocation which is almost ex-post Pareto optimal.

AB In this paper we present empirical evidence on aggregation problems with Euler equations for consumption. Our main results are: estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution for consumption are consistently lower for aggregate data than for average cohort data and the theoretical model is statistically rejected on aggregate data, not rejected on average cohort data. In trying to explain these differences we find that a major role is played by the non-linearity of the estimable equation and by omitted demographic factors (normally unobservable on aggregate data). However, even when these sources of aggregation bias are corrected for, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution obtained from aggregate data remain lower than those obtained from average cohort data, and excess sensitivity tests reject the implications of the model. This can be explained as the result of imposing identical coefficients to cohorts who differ in preferences and/or opportunity sets.

AB Deaton's observation that consumption appears to be ''too smooth'' is easily reconciled with the notion that consumption exhibits ''excess sensitivity'' to current income. The reconciliation invokes the plausible assumption that households forecast on the basis of a larger information set than the econometrician. The empirical case for excess smoothness is strengthened by showing that the innovations in permanent income can be inferred from an autoregression of income and saving, not only under the permanent income hypothesis, but also under the excess sensitivity model. Empirically, parameter restrictions imposed on the bivariate autoregression by the excess sensitivity model are not rejected.

AB This paper examines optimal monetary policy under uncertainty in a context in which policy makers are able to make credible policy commitments. We study an optimal taxation problem of minimizing the social cost of financing a stochastic and exogenous level of government transfers. Since, in the basic model, the welfare costs of inflation derive only from expected inflation, the optimal monetary policy is highly responsive to the state of nature. In a benchmark case in which ail shocks are transitory, the optimal policy calls for loading all the variability of government transfers on the shoulders of the inflation tax.

AB This paper incorporates a model of corporate control into a general equilibrium framework for production economies with incomplete markets. The classical objective of value maximization is extended, but is indeterminate. Instead, firms are viewed as being subject to shareholder control via some decision mechanism. As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous preference by shareholders, shareholder control is consistent with but stronger than value maximization. Next, the particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown that for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is optimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder. Finally, a more realistic control mechanism is considered in which majority voting by shareholders is constrained by a group of shareholders, or Board of Directors, who control the voting agenda. The result is that shareholders not on the Board have no influence on the equilibrium production choice of the firm.

The strategic behaviour of informed insiders and uninformed liquidity traders implies that a growing number of market makers leads to a higher risk exposure for the individual market maker which induces higher individual bid-ask-spreads and higher transaction costs for the liquidity traders. Under certain conditions liquidity traders would prefer a monopolistic market maker rather than several competing market makers. The results hold under various assumptions on the strategy space of the market makers.

TI FISCAL-POLICY IN GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS CYCLES; TIME
AB This paper studies four classic fiscal-policy experiments within a quantitatively restricted neoclassical model. Our main findings are as follows: (i) permanent changes in government purchases can lead to short-run and long-run output multipliers that exceed 1; (ii) permanent changes in government purchases induce larger effects than temporary changes; (iii) the financing decision is quantitatively more important than the resource cost of changes in government purchases, and (iv) public investment has dramatic effects on private output and investment. These findings stem from important dynamic interactions of capital and labor absent in earlier equilibrium analyses of fiscal policy.

ID DISTURBANCES; SYSTEMS
AB We estimate a dynamic two-country model in which economic fluctuations are driven by a worldwide supply shock, country-specific supply shocks, and relative fiscal, money, and preference shocks. Identification is achieved using only long-run restrictions, based on a theoretical model. The main results, are: (i) supply shocks, particularly country-specific ones, are very important in generating international business cycles, (ii) although the post-1973 flexible-exchange-rate period has been inherently more volatile, there are no differences in transmission properties of economic disturbances across exchange-rate regimes for the endogenous variables we focus on.

TI THE AGGREGATE IMPLICATIONS OF MACHINE REPLACEMENT - THEORY AND EVIDENCE
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; INVESTMENT; MODELS; COST
AB We study an economy in which producers incur resource costs to replace depreciated machines. The process of costly replacement and depreciation creates endogenous fluctuations in productivity, employment, and output of a single producer. We explore the spillover effects of machine replacement on other sectors of the economy and provide conditions for synchronized machine replacement by multiple independent producers. The implications of our model are generally consistent with observed monthly output, employment, and productivity fluctuations in automobile plants. Synchronization of retooling across plants within the auto industry is widespread, so that the fluctuations observed at the plant level have aggregate implications.

TI PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY CONTROL AT THE GENERAL-MOTORS-CORPORATION

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; MODELS
AB This paper analyzes dynamics of production and inventories at the General Motors Corporation during the 1920's and 1930's. We begin by examining anecdotal evidence on the nature of the production control system in force during that period. Motivated by that evidence, we then extend the conventional linear-quadratic model of production behavior to take account of annual shutdown. Finally, we apply the modified model to newly available data on monthly unit production, sales, and inventories during 1924 - 1940. GM appears to have been aiming to maintain a targeted level of inventory relative to expected sales and, secondarily, to smooth production.

TI EXPLAINING SAVING INVESTMENT CORRELATIONS
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English

ID INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS; SMALL OPEN-ECONOMY; BUSINESS CYCLES;
   COUNTRIES; MOBILITY; RATES; TIME
AB National saving and investment rates are highly positively correlated in virtually all countries. This is puzzling, as it apparently implies a low degree of international capital mobility. This paper shows that the observed positive correlation between national saving and investment rates arises naturally within a quantitatively restricted equilibrium model with perfect mobility of financial and physical capital. The model is consistent with the fact that saving - investment correlations are larger for larger countries but are still substantial for small countries. Further, the model is consistent with the finding that current-account deficits tend to be associated with investment booms.

TI LOW INVESTMENT AND LARGE LDC DEBT IN THE 1980S
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH
AB This paper aims at disentangling the correlation between LDC debt and investment in the 1980's. I show that a large debt was not an unconditional predictor of low investment in the 1980's, nor was investment abnormally low, when compared to a ''financial-autarky'' rate, calculated in the text. I do find, however, that the actual service of the debt crowded out investment. For the rescheduling countries I show that 1 percent of GDP paid abroad reduced domestic investment by 0.3 percent of GDP. This is identical to the correlation between investment and foreign finance observed in the 1960's.

ID EXPECTATIONS; MODELS
AB One of the most puzzling aspects of the floating-exchange-rate regime since 1973 has been the apparent irrationality embedded in investors' exchange-rate expectations. This paper investigates whether exchange-rate forecasts, although biased, are still rational. The idea is that investors can be rational and yet make repeated mistakes if the true model of the exchange rate is evolving over time. My results support the hypothesis that the exchange rate has followed a switching-regime process. Moreover, the switching-regime model estimated can explain about 75 percent of the bias implied by the forward market and the survey data.

ID EXCHANGE-RATES; UNITED-STATES; PASS-THROUGH; PRICES
AB The paper measures the degree of price discrimination across export destinations that is associated with exchange-rate changes using U.S., U.K, German, and Japanese industry-level data. Given the industries sampled, more price discrimination across destinations is observed in the U.K, German, and Japanese data. For industries that match across source countries, however, behavior is very similar across source countries. Furthermore, destination-specific price adjustment on exports to the United States from Germany and Japan is similar to price adjustment observed on shipments to other destinations. Most variation in the data appears to be related to industry.

AB This paper proposes a new way to generalize the insights of static asset pricing theory to a multiperiod setting. The paper uses a loglinear approximation to the budget constraint to substitute out consumption from a standard intertemporal asset pricing model. In a homoscedastic lognormal setting, the consumption-wealth ratio is shown to depend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, while asset risk premia are determined by the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk premia are related to the covariances of asset returns with the market return and with news about the discounted value of all future market returns.

ID OLIGOPOLY
AB In Cournot-based oligopoly models, there is an incentive for firms to pursue overly aggressive behavior, resulting in prices and profits below those of the Cournot equilibrium. Compensating managers in proportion to a combination of profits and sales provides one mechanism through which aggressive behavior emerges. However, when the profit component of managerial compensation comes in the form of stock options, the aggressive behavior is restrained or even eliminated in equilibrium. This result relies only on the nonlinearity of the stock option; generalizations to other forms of compensation are discussed.

AB This paper Presents an economic institution which enabled 11th-century traders to benefit from employing overseas agents despite the commitment problem inherent in these relations. Agency relations were governed by a coalition - an economic institution in which expectations, implicit contractual relations, and a specific information-transmission mechanism supported the operation of a reputation mechanism. Historical records and a simple game-theoretical model are used to examine this institution. The study highlights the interaction between social and economic institutions, the determinants of business practices, the nature of the merchants' law, and the interrelations between market and nonmarket institutions.

The results show that prices increased on routes served by the merging firms relative to a control group of routes unaffected by the merger. Mergers may lead to more efficient operations, but on the whole, the impact of efficiency gains on airfares is more than offset by exercise of increased market power.

ID EXACT AGGREGATION; SYSTEMS; THEOREM; MODEL
AB The aim of this paper is to assess the importance of using micro-level data in the econometric analysis of consumer demand To do this we utilize a time series of repeated cross sections covering some 4,000 households in each of 15 years. Employing a number of different aggregation procedures, we conclude that aggregate data alone are unlikely to produce reliable estimates of structural price and income coefficients. However, once certain ''aggregation factors'' as well as trend and seasonal components are included, an aggregate model is not necessarily outperformed across all demand equations in terms of forecasting ability.

AB An important step in extending the traditional theory of individual rational choice to analyze social issues beyond those usually considered by economists is to incorporate into the theory a much richer class of attitudes, preferences, and calculations. While this approach to behavior builds on an expanded theory of individual choice, it is not mainly concerned with individuals. It uses theory at the micro level as a powerful tool to derive implications at the group or macro level. The lecture describes the approach and illustrates it with examples drawn from my past and current work.

TI WAGE INEQUALITY AND THE RISE IN RETURNS TO SKILL
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Using data from the March Current Population Survey, we document an increase over the past 30 years in wage inequality for males. Between 1963 and 1989, real average weekly wages for the least skilled workers (as measured by the tenth percentile of the wage distribution) declined by about 5 percent, whereas wages for the most skilled workers (as measured by the ninetieth percentile of the wage distribution) rose by about 40 percent. We find that the trend toward increased wage inequality is apparent within narrowly defined education and labor market experience groups. Our interpretation is that much of the increase in wage inequality for males over the last 20 years is due to increased returns to the components of skill other than years of schooling and years of labor market experience. Our primary explanation for the general rise in returns to skill is that the demand for skill rose in the United States over this period.

ID QUALITY; GROWTH; TRADE; CURVE
AB This paper attempts to integrate traditional models of invention and learning by doing, developing a model that emphasizes the interdependence between research activity in the laboratory and production experience on the factory floor. Learning depends on invention in that learning by doing is viewed as the exploration of the finite and bounded productive potential of invented technologies. At the same time, the profitability of costly invention is dependent on learning in that costs of production depend on cumulative learning experience. The model is a true hybrid, allowing for circumstances in which either the incentives to engage in research and/or the incentives to produce different goods are the binding constraints on growth.

ID DISPERSION
AB A single seller of an indivisible good operates in a market with many consumers who differ in their ability to process information. The consumers' constraints are modeled in two submodels: the first in terms of the limits on the number of sets in the partition of the price space, and the second in terms of the limits on the complexity of the operation he can use to process a price offer. For the construction of the second submodel, the tool of a ''perceptron'' is borrowed from the parallel computation literature. Assuming a negative correlation between the seller's cost of supply of the good and the consumer's ability to process information, I demonstrate that the heterogeneity of consumers' abilities can be used by the seller to profitably discriminate among them.

TI OPTIMAL TAXATION IN MODELS OF ENDOGENOUS GROWTH
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPITAL INCOME; POLICY; EQUILIBRIUM; ECONOMY
AB We study the problem of optimal taxation in three infinite-horizon, representative-agent endogenous growth models. The first model is a convex model in which physical and human capital are perfectly symmetric. Our second model incorporates elastic labor supply through a Lucas-style technology. Analysis of these two models points out the danger of assuming that government expenditures are exogenous. In our third model, we include government expenditures as a productive input in capital formation, showing that the limiting tax rate on capital is no longer zero. In numerical simulations, we find similar effects on growth and welfare in all three models.

TI DETECTION OF BID RIGGING IN PROCUREMENT AUCTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTRACTORS
AB This paper examines bidding in auctions for state highway construction contracts, in order to determine whether bid rigging occurred. Detection of collusion is possible because of limited participation in the collusive scheme. Collusion did not take the form of a bid rotation scheme. Instead, several ring members bid on most jobs. One was a serious bidder, and the others submitted phony higher bids. The bids of noncartel firms, as well as their rank distribution, were related to cost measures. In contrast, the rank distribution of higher cartel bids was unrelated to similar cost measures and differed from that of the low cartel bid.

TI MONITORING COSTS IN CHINESE AGRICULTURAL TEAMS
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB Large productivity gains have been observed in Chinese agriculture following the transition from collective farming to household contracting. Using a model of mutual monitoring in an egalitarian production team, we estimate that labor supervision absorbed about 10-20 percent of total labor time for a sample of Chinese agricultural teams during 1970-76. These agency costs are lower than comparable estimates derived from aggregate data.

AB Internal consistency of choice has been a central concept in demand theory, social choice theory, decision theory, behavioral economics, and related fields.  It is argued here that this idea is essentially confused, and there is no way of determining whether a choice function is consistent or not without referring to something external to choice behavior (such as objectives, values, or norms). We have to re-examine the robustness of the standard results in this light. The main formal result presented here is an extension of Arrow's General Possibility Theorem. This drops the need to impose any condition of internal consistency of social choice, or any internal notion of ''social rationality.''

AB In a self-confirming equilibrium, each player's strategy is a best response to his beliefs about the play of his opponents, and each player's beliefs are correct along the equilibrium path of play. Thus, if a self-confirming equilibrium occurs repeatedly, no player ever observes play that contradicts his beliefs, even though beliefs about play at off-path information sets need not be correct. We characterize the ways in which self-confirming equilibria and Nash equilibria can differ, and provide conditions under which self-confirming equilibria correspond to standard solution concepts.

AB We study the steady states of a system in which players learn about the strategies their opponents are playing by updating their Bayesian priors in light of their observations. Players are matched at random to play a fixed extensive-form game, and each player observes the realized actions in his own matches, but not the intended off-path play of his opponents or the realized actions in other matches. Because players are assumed to live finite lives, there are steady states in which learning continually takes place. If lifetimes are long and players are very patient, the steady state distribution of actions approximates that of a Nash equilibrium.

AB This paper introduces the concept of standard risk aversion. A von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function has standard risk aversion if every risk that has a negative interaction with a small reduction in wealth also has a negative interaction with any undesirable, independent risk. It is shown that, given monotonicity and concavity, the combination of decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing absolute prudence is necessary and sufficient for standard risk aversion. Standard risk aversion is shown to imply not only Pratt and Zeckhauser's ''proper risk aversion'' (an undesirable risk always remaining undesirable in the presence of an independent undesirable risk), but also that being forced to face an undesirable risk reduces the optimal investment in a risky security with an independent return.

DE COMPLETE MARKETS; INESSENTIALITY; NO-TRADE THEOREM; SEQUENCE ECONOMIES;

ID EXPECTATIONS; EQUILIBRIUM
AB Consider a sequence economy in which small agents trade event-contingent claims to a single physical good. The agents have uncommon priors, state-contingent utility functions, and asymmetric information in every period. The claims traded vary from period to period. An equilibrium is inessential if, at the equilibrium prices, agents have alternate optimal plans that clear opening markets and require no trades in later markets.
   Theorem 1 shows that inessentiality obtains if the claims traded in opening markets span the claims traded in later markets, each agent can insure herself against improvements in her private information, and agents' initial information satisfies a weak symmetry condition. Theorem 2 shows that inessentiality obtains if opening claims satisfy a stronger, backward-looking spanning condition. Theorem 3 shows that inessentiality obtains if opening claims span payoff-relevant events, opening and later markets satisfy a statistical relationship, and agents are risk averse. None of the theorems requires ex ante Pareto optimality or the absence of arbitrage opportunities. The theorems shed light on previous questions concerning the conditions permitting speculation and the role of price-contingent trading.

AB In this model, shareholders can use auditors' reports to contract with a privately-informed manager. Our imperfect audit technology allows the auditor and the manager to collude. Auditors are useful only if they have good information and if the manager's liability is high. Expected maximum deterrence is not desirable and production is suboptimal, even with unbounded punishments, risk-neutral agents, and costless auditing. Raising the manager's punishment raises the bribe he may offer the auditor, which raises the cost of preventing collusion. We also distinguish internal auditors (who are costless but may collude) from external ones (who are costly but never collude) and show that the optimal contract may specify random external audits.

AB The purpose of this paper is to study the role and implications of price advertising when shopping trips are costly to consumers. To do so, we introduce advertising into an optimal sequential search model.  Information about prices is both gathered by consumers and disseminated by firms. Consumers search sequentially and stores advertise (with various intensity) when it is in their interest to do so. Our model has a unique equilibrium exhibiting price dispersion. The model generates predictions about the shape of the price distribution and firms' advertising behavior. We explore the effects of entry, and find that when initial advertising costs (at zero level of effort) are precisely zero, entry drives the equilibrium to the perfectly competitive outcome. However, when initial marginal advertising costs are positive, entry drives prices higher, and while the informed consumers almost surely locate competitive prices, welfare does not necessarily increase. Finally, we compare the effectiveness of the two informational channels. When advertising costs shrink, prices become competitive; however, When search costs shrink, prices remain bounded above marginal production costs.

ID PRICES; VOLATILITY; TESTS; DIVIDENDS; MODELS
AB Major long-run swings in the U. S. stock market over the past century are broadly consistent with a model driven by changes in current and expected future dividends in which investors must estimate the time-varying long-run dividend growth rate. Such an estimated long-run growth rate resembles a long distributed lag on past dividend growth, and is highly correlated with the level of dividends. Prices therefore respond more than proportionately to long-run movements in dividends. The time-varying component of dividend growth need not be detectable in the dividend data for it to have large effects on stock prices.

ID BANKRUPTCY; COSTS; DEBT
AB We examine changes in the pricing and financial structure of large management buyouts in the 1980s. Over time, (1) buyout price to cash flow ratios rose in absolute terms (particularly in deals financed using public junk bonds); (2) required bank principal repayments accelerated, leading to sharply lower ratios of cash flow to total debt obligations; (3) private subordinated and bank debt were replaced by public junk debt; and (4) management teams and dealmakers took more money out of transactions up front. These patterns are consistent with an ''overheating'' phenomenon in the buyout market. Preliminary post-buyout evidence lends some support to this interpretation.

ID PRICE ADJUSTMENT; LABOR DEMAND; COSTS; MONEY
AB The basic premise of this paper is that understanding aggregate dynamics requires considering that agents are heterogeneous and that they do not adjust continuously to the shocks they perceive. We provide a general characterization of lumpy behavior at the microeconomic level in terms of an adjustment-hazard function, which relates the probability that a unit adjusts to the deviation of its state variable from its moving target. We characterize rich, cross-sectionally dependent aggregate dynamics generated by nonconstant hazards. We present an example based on U. S. manufacturing employment and job flows, and find that increasing-hazard models outperform constant-hazard-partial-adjustment models in describing aggregate employment dynamics.

TI TAXATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF LABOR-MARKETS - THE CASE OF CORPORATISM
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB We propose an explanation for the wide variation in rates of taxation across developed economies, based on differences in labor market institutions. In ''corporatist'' economies, which feature centralized labor markets, taxes on labor input will be less distortionary than when labor supply is determined individually. Since the level of labor supply is set by a small group of decision-makers, these individuals will recognize the linkage between the taxes that workers pay and the benefits that they receive. Labor tax burdens are indeed higher in more corporatist nations, while nonlabor taxes are actually lower. There is also some evidence that the distortionary effects of labor taxes are lower in more corporatist economies.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines tax-return-generated data on the labor force behavior of people before and after they receive inheritances. The results are consistent with Andrew Carnegie's century-old assertion that large inheritances decrease a person's labor force participation. For example, a single person who receives an inheritance of about $150,000 is roughly four times more likely to leave the labor force than a person with an inheritance below $25,000. Additional, albeit weaker, evidence suggests that large inheritances depress labor supply, even when participation is unaltered.

DT Article
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; ECONOMICS; EXCHANGE
AB This paper reports the results of an experiment that was designed to test the impact of fairness on market prices. Prices were determined in a one-sided oral auction, with buyers as price-makers. Upon acceptance of an offer, sellers determined the quality of the good. Buyers offered prices that were substantially above the market-clearing level and expected sellers to respond with high quality levels. This expectation was, on average, confirmed by the behavior of sellers. These results provide, therefore, experimental support for the fair wage-effort theory of involuntary unemployment.

TI SELECTION IN THE MARKET FOR SLAVES - NEW-ORLEANS, 1830-1860
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Greenwald and Glasspiegel argue that adverse selection depressed the market prices of slaves, causing current researchers to overestimate the rate of return from slavery. In this paper we test for the presence of adverse selection by comparing the prices of local slaves with the prices of slaves sold from estate sales. We find no difference in the prices of these slaves, from which we conclude that there was no significant adverse selection in the market. Instead, we propose an alternative explanation for the observed pattern of slave prices based on the costs of shipping slaves to the New Orleans market.

It extends Bernanke's [1986] work by weakening the set of just-identifying restrictions and by providing a statistical test of the overidentifying restrictions. Instead of specifying a structural model to identify primitive shocks, I deduce the impact effects of structural money shocks under the neutrality hypothesis and then test whether the system maintains neutrality as it propagates these impact effects. The tests reject neutrality for both the M1 and the monetary base.

AB This paper presents evidence on the nature of productivity growth for five major industries in six countries. Output growth is found to be more correlated across countries than productivity growth. In addition, productivity growth is more correlated across industries within one country than across countries within one industry. Using an error-components model, I find that a substantial fraction of changes in annual productivity can be attributed to nation-specific factors that are common across industries. The evidence suggests that short-run productivity growth is similar across industries in a nation but less similar across countries in any specific industry.

Using a structural model of labor hoarding and the identifying restriction that innovations to technology shocks are orthogonal to innovations in government consumption, we estimate the fraction of the variability of the Solow residual that is due to technology shocks. Our results support the view that a significant proportion of movements in the Solow residual are artifacts of labor hoarding behavior. Specifically, we estimate that the variance of innovations to technology is roughly 50 percent less than that implied by standard real business cycle models. In addition, our results suggest that existing real business cycle studies substantially overstate the extent to which technology shocks account for the variability of postwar aggregate U.S. output.

TI OCCUPATIONAL CHOICE AND THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; INCREASING RETURNS; INDUSTRIALIZATION
AB This paper models economic development as a process of institutional transformation by focusing on the interplay between agents' occupational decisions and the distribution of wealth. Because of capital market imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wage over self-employment, and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with sufficient inequality, however, will there be employment contracts; otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the latter is itself endogenous, we demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model dynamically and studying examples in which initial wealth distributions have long-run effects. In one case the economy develops either widespread cottage industry (self-employment) or factory production (employment contracts), depending on the initial distribution; in the other example, it develops into prosperity or stagnation.

AB The hypothesis that takeovers provide managers with the incentive to maximize firm value is tested by examining the relationship between profitability and state statutes governing takeover activity among banks. The evidence indicates that firms in states with an active takeover market are more profitable. When takeover activity is restricted, increased use of other mechanisms that provide an incentive to maximize firm value, such as concentration of equity ownership and management ownership of stock, is observed. However, these alternative methods have a smaller effect on profitability and do not completely compensate for the absence of an active takeover market.

AB At the microeconomic level, durable purchases are often discontinuous and relatively large. This feature has the potential to explain why aggregate expenditure on durables responds only slowly (relative to the frictionless permanent income model) to wealth and other aggregate innovations. In this paper I develop new results on the problem of dynamic aggregation of stochastically heterogeneous units, which help to characterize the connection between microeconomic behavior and aggregate dynamics in the presence of nonconvex adjustment costs. Using these results and splitting postwar U.S. aggregate durable purchases into different subcategories and time periods, I provide further support for the view that lumpy microeconomic purchases play an important role in explaining the time-series behavior of aggregate expenditure on durable goods.

They rationally extract information from prices as well as dividends and maximize their expected utility. The model has a closed-form solution to the rational expectations equilibrium. We find that existence of uninformed investors increases the risk premium. Supply shocks can affect the risk premium only under asymmetric information. Information asymmetry among investors can increase price volatility and negative autocorrelation in returns. Less-informed investors may rationally behave like price chasers.

ID REPEATED GAMES; EXCHANGE; MONEY; EQUILIBRIUM
AB We use the framework of random matching games and develop a two-country model of the world economy, in which two national currencies compete and may be circulated as media of exchange. There are multiple equilibria, which differ in the areas of circulation of the two currencies. In one equilibrium, the two national currencies are circulated only locally. In another, one currency is circulated as an international currency. There is also an equilibrium in which both currencies are accepted internationally. We also find an equilibrium in which the two currencies are directly exchanged.
   We first characterize the existence conditions of these equilibria in terms of the relative country size and the degree of economic integration and then use an evolutionary approach to equilibrium selection to explain the evolution of the international currency as the two economies become more integrated.
   Some welfare implications are also discussed. For example, a country can improve its national welfare by letting its own currency circulate internationally, provided the domestic circulation is controlled for. When the total supply is fixed, however, a resulting currency shortage may reduce the national welfare.

DT Article
AB This paper studies a class of information transmission processes which we call rumours. The distinctive features of these processes are that the information transmission takes place in such a way that the recipient does not quite know whether or not to believe the information, and that the probability that someone receives the information depends on how many people already have it.
   Specifically, we study an example in which there is an investment project with returns only known to a few people. These people have a cost of undertaking the project and this cost is private information. The only information the other agents receive is that someone else has invested. They are not told whether that person actually knew the returns, or whether he too was just acting on the basis of his observation of others.
   They use their optimal Bayesian decision rule to decide whether to invest. We show that, for a wide class of alternative specifications, this decision rule has the property that a positive fraction of those who observe the rumour will not invest. In this sense a rumour cannot mislead everybody.
   Counter-intuitive comparative statics results are obtained. For example, more information and higher productivity may reduce welfare, while changing the speed with which the rumour spreads has no welfare effect.

AB A simple dynamic model of rational learning through market interaction by asymmetrically informed risk-neutral agents, uncertain about a valuation parameter but whose pooled information reveals it, is presented. The model is a variation of the classical partial equilibrium model of learning in rational expectations in which the market price is informative about the unknown parameter only through the actions of agents. It is found that learning from market prices and convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium is slow, at the rate 1/square-root n1/3 (where n is the number periods of market interaction), whenever the average precision of private information in the market is finite. Convergence obtains at the standard rate 1/square-root n if there is a positive mass of perfectly informed agents. Comparative static results on more refined measures of the speed of convergence with respect to basic technological and informational parameters are also provided.

AB This paper explores the role of complementarities and incomplete markets in economic growth. We analyze the evolution of an economy composed of a countable set of industries. Individual industries exhibit non-convexities in production and are linked by localized technological complementarities. These complementarities, when strong enough, produce multiple equilibria in long-run economic activity. The equilibria have a simple probabilistic structure that demonstrates how local interactions can affect the aggregate equilibrium. The model generates interesting cross-sectional and intertemporal dynamics as coordination problems become the source of aggregate and individual industry volatility. The model also illustrates how the growth of leading sectors can cause a takeoff to a high aggregate production equilibrium.

ID OPTIMAL CONSUMPTION; UNCERTAINTY; DECISIONS; POLICIES; MODEL
AB This paper derives the explicit solution of a dynamic stochastic optimal consumption problem for infinitely-lived agents whose preferences exhibit, in the presence of non-diversifiable labour income uncertainty, a constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution and constant absolute risk aversion. The constancy of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which implies that marginal utility at zero consumption is infinite, guarantees that the non-negativity constraint on consumption is never binding along the optimal path. The assumption of constant absolute risk aversion allows an explicit computation of human wealth, and provides a simple representation of the precautionary savings motive.

AB This paper analyses life-cycle consumption plans and distinguishes between temporal risk aversion and intertemporal substitution. The results assume that felicity functions are quadratic and that income follows a linear model with normally distributed errors. Stochastic dynamic programming then yields closed-loop linear decision rules. Certainty equivalence no longer holds, but instead households play a min-max strategy against nature. One finds a rationale for precautionary saving and a larger sensitivity of changes in consumption to income innovations.

AB The costs of hiring a worker generally differ in size from the firing costs. This article investigates optimal labour demand schedules for production and non-production workers of firms that operate under uncertainty and face asymmetric costs of adjusting their workforce.
   In the empirical part generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimates of the structural parameters of the Euler conditions for production and non-production workers are presented, together with specification and structural stability tests, using time series data of the Netherlands and U.K. manufacturing sectors.
   We find that asymmetric adjustment costs play an important role in the explanation of unbalanced labour demand between upward and downward movements of the business cycle. Moreover, hiring costs exceed firing costs of production workers, whereas firing costs exceed hiring costs of non-production workers.

AB Although models with factor price equalization are used frequently in both theoretical and applied research in international economics, only sufficient conditions for factor price equalization have been presented in the literature. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for FPE under quite general assumptions about the technologies of different countries. The necessary and sufficient conditions we derive are consistent with joint production, decreasing returns to scale, and substantive differences in the technologies and endowments of different countries. Our results enable us to reconcile the classical approach and the integrated equilibrium approach to factor price equalization.

AB Suppose that a seller and a buyer have private valuations for a good, and that their respective utilities from a trading mechanism are given by u(s) and u(b). (These utilities are determined by the valuation for the good, by whether a trade occurs, and by the price which is paid.) Consider the problem of maximizing E[lambdau(s) + (I - lambda)u(b)] for some weight lambda in the unit interval. It is shown in this article that, if lambda is sufficiently close to zero or one, then the maximum value of this objective function attainable by a static revelation mechanism can be arbitrarily closely approximated by equilibria of the sequential bargaining games in which only a single player makes offers. That is, the welfare bound implied by the revelation principle is virtually attainable in offer/counter offer bargaining. The main condition needed for this result is a monotone-hazard-rate assumption about the distribution of types. A class of examples is presented in which the result holds for all lambda (i.e. the entire ex ante Pareto frontier).

AB We explore a sequential offers model of n-person coalitional bargaining with transferable utility and with time discounting. Our focus is on the efficiency properties of stationary equilibria of strictly superadditive games, when the discount factor delta is sufficiently large; we do, however, consider examples of other games where subgame perfectness alone is employed.
   It is shown that delay and the formation of inefficient subcoalitions can occur in equilibrium, the latter for some or all orders of proposer. However, efficient stationary equilibrium payoffs converge to a point in the core, as delta --> 1. Strict convexity is a sufficient condition for there to exist an efficient stationary equilibrium payoff vector for sufficiently high delta. This vector converges as delta --> 1 to the egalitarian allocation of Dutta and Ray (1989).

ID RISK
AB Consider risk-averse agents with utility functions U and V holding portfolios composed of the same two (risky and riskless) assets. Then V is (Arrow) more risk averse if in all such portfolios V invests less in the risky asset.  A natural extension of this analysis of attitudes towards risk to risk itself is to establish a relation between distributions which is necessary and sufficient to induce such investment patterns in the class of all risk-averse agents. This characterization is established in this paper for distributions with equal means. Second Degree Dominance performs a similar role for the notion of 'more risk averse' introduced by Pratt but it is too weak for the Arrow concept.

ID INCREASING RISK; UTILITY
AB Contrary to common belief, Savage's axioms do not imply strict stochastic dominance. Instead, they usually involve violation of that. Violations occur as soon as the range of the utility function is rich enough, e.g, contains an interval, and the probability measure is, loosely speaking, ''constructive''. An example is given where all of Savage's axioms are satisfied, but still strict statewise monotonicity is violated: An agent is willing to exchange an act for another act that with certainty yields a strictly worse outcome. Thus book can be made against the agent Weak stochastic dominance and weak statewise monotonicity are always satisfied, as well as strict stochastic dominance and strict statewise monotonicity when restricted to acts with finitely many outcomes.

If government spending follows an upward-trending stochastic process which the public believes may fall sharply when it reaches specific ''trigger'' points, then optimizing consumption behavior and simple budget-constraint arithmetic imply a nonlinear relationship between private consumption and government spending. This theoretical relation is consistent with the experience of several countries. (JEL E62, E21)

It is shown that the less uncertain are voters as to which policy is best, the more likely is a politician to manipulate policy for reelection purposes. Manipulation entails implementing the policy that is more likely to be well received rather than the one that maximizes income. (JEL D78, E60)

Zero accumulation is a possible equilibrium with both noncooperative and cooperative behavior. Countries may also accumulate weapons to the point where conflict initiation never occurs.

By limiting the degree of flexibility permitted in policy, this procedure mitigates the credibility problem. As the length of the targeting horizon decreases, the severity of the credibility problem falls, but at the expense of weakening the monetary authority's ability to pursue its stabilization goals. Based on model simulations, the analysis studies the determinants of the optimal targeting horizon that balances the benefits of flexibility and discipline in policy. (JEL E50, F61)

The reason is that deterring entry at one stage affects the cost of doing so in later stages. This force can be so powerful that entry is deterred only at the final stage. The persistence of monopoly or its erosion over time depends on the timing of arrival of capacity, the size of early versus subsequent capacity availability, the length of the capacity-acquisition stage relative to the life of the industry, and the discount factor.(JEL C72, D42, D44, F13, L12)

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMAL ROAD CAPACITY
AB This paper considers the modeling of road congestion subject to peak-load demand. The standard model contains ambiguities and is poorly specified. These problems can be eliminated by working with a structural model that explicitly treats the congestion technology and drivers' behavioral decisions. The paper provides a detailed analysis of a particular structural model - William Vickrey's model of bottleneck congestion in the morning rush-hour auto commute, extended to treat elastic (i.e., price-sensitive) demand-and examines some economic implications of the structural approach.

AB This paper studies the process of entry, dumping, and shakeout and the properties of the free-trade equilibrium that results in a world in which countries differ in their stock of technological knowledge, but not necessarily in their stock of technological capability. The model can account for the dumping of products by newly industrializing countries and technological newcomers at a price that fails to cover average cost in the face of a surge in world demand for the dumped product, a phenomenon that has not been uncommon in recent years.

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between changes in unionization and firm growth. Average growth is significantly lower in manufacturing firms that experience successful union elections, but these strong ''effects'' are largely illusory. We find no evidence of a significant relationship between unionization and firm growth, despite a strong cyclical pattern in election activity. Our results suggest that the significant negative effect of organizing activity on a firm's market value is not accompanied by any growth changes. We therefore cannot reject the hypothesis that the equity losses from union election activity represent a simple transfer of wealth from shareholders to workers. (JEL J50)

AB Different extensive form games with the same reduced normal form can have different information sets and subgames. This generates a tension between a belief in the strategic relevance of information sets and subgames and a belief in the sufficiency of the reduced normal form. We identify a property of extensive form information sets and subgames which we term strategic independence. Strategic independence is captured by the reduced normal form, and can be used to define normal form information sets and subgames. We prove a close relationship between these normal form structures and their extensive form namesakes. Using these structures, we are able to motivate and implement solution concepts corresponding to subgame perfection, sequential equilibrium, and forward induction entirely in the reduced normal form, and show close relations between their implications in the normal and extensive form.

AB Perfect equilibria of finitely repeated games may be vulnerable to the possibility of renegotiation among players. We study the limiting properties of the set of payoffs from equilibria that are immune to renegotiation. Our main result is that the limit of the set of payoffs from renegotiation proof equilibria is either a singleton or a connected subset of the Pareto efficient frontier. A simple sufficient condition for the latter to occur is also provided.

AB A two-person game is of conflicting interests if the strategy to which player one would most like to commit herself holds player two down to his minimax payoff. Suppose there is a positive prior probability that player one is a ''commitment type'' who will always play this strategy. Then player one will get at least her commitment payoff in any Nash equilibrium of the repeated game if her discount factor approaches one. This result is robust against further perturbations of the informational structure and in striking contrast to the message of the Folk Theorem for games with incomplete information.

AB This paper specifies and empirically analyzes a continuous-time, linear-quadratic, representative consumer model with time-nonseparable preferences of several forms. Within this framework I show how time aggregation and time nonseparabilities in preferences over consumption streams can interact. The behavior of both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted consumption data is consistent with time-nonseparable preferences if consumption goods are durable and if individuals develop habit over the flow of services from the good. The data do not support a version of the model that ignores time nonseparabilities in preferences and focuses solely upon time aggregation.

The estimator is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, and to achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte-Carlo evidence indicates that there may be only modest efficiency losses relative to maximum likelihood estimation when the distribution of the disturbances is known, and that the small-sample behavior of the estimator in other cases is good.

AB Official measures of poverty in the United States are compiled by the Bureau of the Census by comparing a household's income level to a prespecified threshold. From a theoretical perspective it is more appropriate to evaluate the level of poverty using a consumption-based measure of household welfare. In this paper I evaluate the level of poverty using expenditure data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I find that consumption-based poverty rates are much lower than those based on income. The trend in the poverty rate in the United States is sensitive to the price index and equivalence scales used to adjust the poverty thresholds.

ID PERMANENT INCOME; INDIA
AB Many households in developing countries rely on seasonal agriculture for their incomes. This paper investigates whether household consumption expenditure tracks income across seasons. Using data from Thailand, I contrast the seasonal consumption patterns of households with different seasonal income patterns and estimate the responsiveness of seasonal consumption to seasonal income. I find little evidence that consumption tracks income over the course of the year. The findings suggest that observed seasonal consumption patterns are the result of seasonal variations in preferences or prices, common to all households, rather than an inability of households to use savings behavior to smooth consumption.

AB Characteristics of business cycles are quite different across developed countries. Real wages and working hours are less sensitive to exogenous shocks in the United States than they are in Britain and Japan. Using a model with a microeconomic foundation, this paper provides an economic explanation of these differences. The cost of on-the-job training plays a crucial role. Workers seldom quit their jobs when the sunk training cost is high. In such economies variances in employment and output become small and shocks tend to be absorbed by working hours and real wages. Thus these characteristics do not necessarily indicate that the economy is more efficient.

ID TECHNICAL CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; JAPAN
AB This paper investigates the role of induced innovation in the development of American agriculture from 1880 to 1980. The induced innovation hypothesis, most closely associated with the work of Hayami and Ruttan, argues that successful economies develop technologies in accordance with market price signals to loosen constraints on growth imposed by factor scarcities. Our analysis employing new state and regional level data fails to find support for Hayami and Ruttan's hypothesis. This paper suggests that many of the fundamental generalizations about American agricultural development need to be reconsidered and,redirects attention to the role of settlement, changing crop patterns, and biological investments in explaining changes in factor utilization in American agriculture.

AB We report market experiments in which human traders are replaced by ''zero-intelligence'' programs that submit random bids and offers. Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., not permitting traders to sell below their costs or buy above their values) is sufficient to raise the allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative efficiency of a double auction derives largely from its structure, independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have thought; it can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual irrationality.

AB Trade theorists continue to puzzle over their surprisingly small estimates of the impact of trade liberalization on imports. All explanations of the puzzle treat trade liberalization as a given. But the level of trade protection is not exogenous. The theory of endogenous protection predicts that higher levels of import penetration will lead to greater protection. This paper finds that when trade protection is modeled endogenously, its restrictive impact on imports is large, 10 times the size obtained from treating protection exogenously.

AB Product liability ideally should promote efficient levels of product safety, but misdirected liability efforts, may depress beneficial innovations. This paper examines these competing effects of liability costs on product R & D intensity and new product introductions by manufacturing firms. At low to moderate levels of expected liability costs, there is a positive effect of liability costs on product innovation. At very high levels of liability costs, the effect is negative. At the sample mean, liability costs increase R & D intensity by 15 percent. The greater linkage of these effects to product R & D rather than process R & D is consistent with the increased prominence of the design defect doctrine.

AB In most times and places, women on average marry older men. We propose a partial explanation for this difference and for why it is diminishing. In a society in which the economic roles of males are more varied than the roles of females, the relative desirability of females as marriage partners may become evident at an earlier age than is the case for males. We study an equilibrium model in which the males who regard their prospects as unusually good choose to wait until their economic success is revealed before choosing a bride. In equilibrium, the most desirable young females choose successful older males. Young males who believe that time will not treat them kindly will offer to marry at a young age. Although they are aware that young males available for marriage are no bargain, the less desirable young females will be offered no better option than the lottery presented by marrying a young male. We show the, existence of equilibrium for models of this type and explore the properties of equilibrium.

AB This paper examines the short-run responses of price and quantity to exogenous demand shocks for disaggregated U.S. manufacturing industries, using prior information on input-output linkages to identify industries whose fluctuations are likely to function as approximately exogenous demand shocks for other industries. I find that demand shocks induce positive covariation between price and quantity for 16 out of 26 sample industries, controlling for observable cost shift variables. When sample industries are pooled, I estimate that a demand shock which initially raises industry output by 1 percent generates a price increase of 0.182 percent within one year. I find that input-output instruments detect upward sloping supply curves more readily than least squares or other commonly used demand-shift instruments.

AB This paper uses Current Population Survey data to examine whether workers who use a computer at work earn a higher wage rate than otherwise similar workers who do not use a computer at work. A variety of models are estimated to try to correct for unobserved variables that might be correlated with job-related computer use and earnings. Estimates suggest that workers who use computers on their job earn 10 to 15 percent higher wages. Additionally, the expansion in computer use in the 1980s can account for one-third to one-half of the increase in the rate of return to education.

AB This paper considers a manufacturer distributing a product through retailers who compete in price and service, which reduces the time it takes to purchase a good. The mix of these instruments that maximizes collective profit is determined by the tastes of consumers on the ''product margin,'' whereas decentralized retailers consider as well the tastes of consumers on the interretailer margins. Given search or travel costs, consumers with low time costs are overrepresented on the interretailer margins. In considering customers on the wrong margin, retailers are therefore biased toward price competition. This distortion that can be corrected with vertical restraints.

AB Because of financial market imperfections, such as those generated by asymmetric information in financial markets, which lead to breakdowns in markets, like that for equity, in which risks are shared, firms act in a risk-averse manner. The resulting macroeconomic model accounts for many widely observed aspects of actual business cycles: (a) cyclical movements in real product wages, (b) cyclical patterns of output and investment including inventories, (c) sensitivity of the economy to small perturbations, and (d) persistence. More downward flexibility in wages and prices may exacerbate the plight of an economy that is in a deep recession.

Second, we look at the behavior of investment during the episodes associated with the crashes of 1929 and 1987. We find a limited role of market valuation, given fundamentals.

Ants, faced with two identical food sources, were observed to concentrate more on one of these, but after a period they would turn their attention to the other. The same phenomenon has been observed in humans choosing between restaurants. After discussing the nature of foraging and recruitment behavior in ants, a simple model of stochastic recruitment is suggested. This explains the ''herding'' and ''epidemics'' described in the literature on financial markets as corresponding to the equilibrium distribution of a stochastic process rather than to switching between multiple equilibria.

AB This paper attempts to demonstrate how ''diversity theory'' can be applied to the analysis of real-world conservation policies. The specific example chosen to serve as a paradigm concerns preservation priorities among the fifteen species of cranes living wild throughout the world. The example is sufficiently actual to show how diversity theory can be used operationally to frame certain critical conservation questions and to guide us toward answers by providing informative quantitative indicators of what to protect. At the same time the cranes example is rich enough that it illustrates nicely some broad general principles about the economics of diversity preservation.

AB We investigate the channels through which partisan influence from a Presidential administration could affect monetary policy-making. Influence could be a result of direct Presidential pressure exerted on members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or it could be a result of partisan considerations in Presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. To investigate these two channels of influence, we devise and apply a method for estimating parameters of monetary policy reaction functions that can vary across individual members of the FOMC. Our results suggest that the appointments process is the primary mechanism by which partisan differences in monetary policies arise.

AB This paper develops a new measure of reallocation shocks based on the variance of industry stock market excess returns to assess the contribution of sectoral reallocation to unemployment in the postwar U.S. economy. The Beveridge Curve relationship is used to establish that this series isolates reallocation shocks. Reallocation shocks are found to explain only a moderate share of the fluctuations in aggregate unemployment on average over the period. However, reallocation accounted for a substantial share of increases in unemployment in several episodes, particularly the mid-1970s. Reallocation shocks also account for a larger share of fluctuations in unemployment of longer durations than of shorter durations.

First, we characterize the unique outcome of any subgame perfect equilibrium of this game.

During transition from rationing and queues to a market system, a group of low income people loses. The transition involves larger losses for this group if black markets prevail under rationing or queues, while a group of high income consumers gains. Some other comparative statics results are developed for a queue model with black markets.

AB We analyze an evolutionary model with a finite number of players and with noise or mutations. The expansion and contraction of strategies is linked-as usual-to their current relative success, but mutations-which perturb the system away from its deterministic evolution-are present as well. Mutations can occur in every period, so the focus is on the implications of ongoing mutations, not a one-shot mutation. The effect of these mutations is to drastically reduce the set of equilibria to what we term ''long-run equilibria.'' For 2 x 2 symmetric games with two symmetric strict Nash equilibria the equilibrium selected satisfies (for large populations) Harsanyi and Selten's (1988) criterion of risk-dominance. In particular, if both strategies have equal security levels, the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium is selected, even though there is another strict Nash equilibrium.

AB Consider an n-person game that is played repeatedly, but by different agents. In each period, n players are drawn at random from a large finite population. Each player chooses an optimal strategy based on a sample of information about what others players have done in the past. The sampling defines a stochastic process that, for a large class of games that includes coordination games and common interest games, converges almost surely to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Such an equilibrium can be interpreted as the ''conventional'' way of playing the game. If, in addition, the players sometimes experiment or make mistakes, then society occasionally switches from one convention to another. As the likelihood of mistakes goes to zero, only some conventions (equilibria) have positive probability in the limit. These are known as stochastically stable equilibria. They are essentially the same as the risk dominant equilibria in 2 x 2 games, but for general games the two concepts differ. The stochastically stable equilibria are computed by finding a path of least resistance from every equilibrium to every other, and then finding the equilibrium that has lowest overall resistance. This is a special case of a general theorem on perturbed Markov processes that characterizes their stochastically stable states graph-theoretically.

AB We study a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice which captures, in two different interpretations, the notions of local substitution and irreversible purchases of durable goods. The class of preferences we consider excludes all nonlinear time-additive and nearly all the non-time-additive utility functions used in the literature. We discuss heuristically necessary conditions and provide sufficient conditions for a consumption and portfolio policy to be optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate our general theory by solving in a closed form the optimal consumption and portfolio policy for a particular felicity function when the prices of the assets follow a geometric Brownian motion process. The optimal consumption policy in our solution consists of a possible initial ''gulp'' of consumption, or a period of no consumption, followed by a process of cumulative consumption with singular sample paths. In almost all states of nature, the agent consumes periodically and invests more in the risky assets than an agent with time-additive utility whose felicity function has the same curvature and the same time-discount parameter. We compute the equilibrium risk premium in a representative investor economy with a single physical production technology whose rate of return follows a Brownian motion. In addition, we provide some simulation results that demonstrate the properties of the purchase series for durable goods with different half-lives.

AB Han's maximum rank correlation (MRC) estimator is shown to be square-root n-consistent and asymptotically normal. The proof rests on a general method for determining the asymptotic distribution of a maximization estimator, a simple U-statistic decomposition, and a uniform bound for degenerate U-processes. A consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix is provided, along with a result giving the explicit form of this matrix for any model within the scope of the MRC estimator. The latter result is applied to the binary choice model, and it is found that the MRC estimator does not achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound.

AB This paper is concerned with the estimation of first-order autoregressive/unit root models with independent identically distributed normal errors. The models considered include those without an intercept, those with an intercept, and those with an intercept and time trend. The autoregressive (AR) parameter a is allowed to lie in the interval (-1,1], which includes the case of a unit root. Exactly median-unbiased estimators of the AR parameter a are proposed. Exact confidence intervals for this parameter are introduced. Corresponding exactly median-unbiased estimators and exact confidence intervals are also provided for the impulse response function, the cumulative impulse response, and the half life of a unit shock. An unbiased model selection procedure is discussed. The procedures that are introduced are applied to several data series including real exchange rates, the velocity of money, and industrial production.

AB Since the introduction of the autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH) model in Engle (1982), numerous applications of this modeling strategy have already appeared. A common finding in many of these studies with high frequency financial or monetary data concerns the presence of an approximate unit root in the autoregressive polynomial in the univariate time series representation for the conditional second order moments of the process, as in the so-called integrated generalized ARCH (IGARCH) class of models proposed in Engle and Bollerslev (1986). In the IGARCH models shocks to the conditional variance are persistent, in the sense that they remain important for forecasts of all horizons. This idea is readily extended to a multivariate framework. Even though many time series may exhibit persistence in variance, it is likely that several different variables share the same common long-run component. In that situation, the variables are naturally defined to be co-persistent in variance, and the co-persistent linear combination is interpretable as a long-run relationship. Conditions for co-persistence to occur in the multivariate linear GARCH model are presented. These conditions parallel the conditions for linear co-integration in the mean, as developed by Engle and Granger (1987). The presence of co-persistence has important implications for asset pricing relationships and in optimal portfolio allocation decisions. An empirical example relating to the time series properties of nominal U.S. dollar exchange rates for the deutschemark and the British pound provides a simple illustration of the ideas.

The model can explain the volatility and predictability of U.S. stock returns in the period 1871-1986 using either a low discount rate (4% or below) and a large constant risk discount on the stock price, or a higher discount rate (5% or above) and noise trading correlated with fundamentals. The data are not well able to distinguish between these explanations.

ID GROWTH
AB This paper analyzes the role of wealth distribution in macroeconomics through investment in human capital. It is shown that in the presence of credit markets' imperfections and indivisibilities in investment in human capital, the initial distribution of wealth affects aggregate output and investment both in the short and in the long run, as there are multiple steady states. This paper therefore provides an additional explanation for the persistent differences in per-capita output across countries. Furthermore, the paper shows that cross-country differences in macroeconomic adjustment to aggregate shocks can be attributed, among other factors, to differences in wealth and income distribution across countries.

ID ADJUSTMENT; COSTS
AB This paper examines equilibrium in a market with free entry where consumers search and firms set prices on individual units of the commodity. The prices attached to newly produced goods are continuously adjusted. Prices attached to previously produced goods can only be changed at a cost. Thus inflation reduces the real price of goods in inventory awaiting sale. The presence of previously priced goods lowers the reservation price of customers. Thus, inflation cuts into the market power created by the need to search for the good. Consumer welfare is inverse u-shaped in inflation with a strictly positive optimal inflation rate.

ID RELATIVE PRICES; VARIABILITY; LEVEL
AB Aggregate cost uncertainty, arising from real shocks or unanticipated inflation, reduces the informativeness Of prices by scrambling relative and aggregate variations. But when agents can acquire additional information, such increased noise may in fact lead them to become better informed, and price competition will intensify. We examine these issues in a model of search with learning, where consumers search optimally from an unknown price distribution while firms price optimally given consumers' search rules. We show that the decisive factor in whether inflation variability increases or reduces the incentive to search, and thereby market efficiency, is the size of informational costs.

TI HETEROGENEITY AND OUTPUT FLUCTUATIONS IN A DYNAMIC MENU-COST ECONOMY
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRICE ADJUSTMENT; INFLATION
AB When firms face menu costs, the relation between their output and money is highly non-linear. At the aggregate level, however, this needs not be so. In this paper we study the dynamic behaviour of a menu-cost economy where firms are heterogeneous in the shocks they perceive, and the demands and adjustment costs they face. In this context we (i) generalize the Caplin and Spulber (1987) steady-state monetary-neutrality result; (ii) show that uniqueness of equilibria depends not only on the degree of strategic complementarities but also on the degree of dispersion of firms' positions in their price-cycle; (iii) characterize the path of output outside the steady state and show that as strategic complementarities become more important, expansions become longer and smoother than contractions; and (iv) show that the potential impact of monetary shocks is an increasing function of the distance of the economy from its steady state, but thai an uninformed policy maker will have no effect on output on average.

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

DT Article
ID PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET FORECLOSURE; BARGAINING MODEL; MERGERS
AB This paper extends the analysis of transactions cost models of vertical integration to multilateral settings. Its main focus is on supply assurance concerns which arise when several downstream firms are competing for inputs in limited supply. Integration reduces supply assurance concerns for an integrating firm but it may increase them for others. Therefore, to explain the scope of any firm, one must consider the overall network of production and distribution relations. Three fundamental questions are addressed: (1) What are the effects of different integration structures?; (2) What are the determinants of the socially efficient integration structures?; (3) In what way do equilibrium integration structures differ from socially efficient structures?

TI SELF-SELECTION AND MONITORING IN DYNAMIC INCENTIVE PROBLEMS WITH
   INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID LABOR-MARKETS; MONOPOLY
AB A dynamic trading problem is examined in which a monopsonistic employer tries to hire workers whose productivities and reservation wages are private information. The employer can only observe an employee's quality indirectly by monitoring a non-verifiable measure of on-the-job performance. The employer makes contract offers which employees can accept or reject. Once a contract has been accepted it is impossible for the employer to exchange messages with individual employees. On the unique stationary equilibrium path for the contracting game, the employer chooses between two mutually exclusive outcomes. In the market outcome, the employer offers long-term contracts and information is conveyed entirely through self-selection and delayed production. In the monitoring outcome, the employer offers short-term contracts, and contract renegotiation is conditioned by an employee's past performance. A simple characterization theorem is provided which illustrates the often surprising effects of improvements in information in this setting. For example, an employer who is initially offering short-term contracts to exploit performance information may stop monitoring and shift to market screening when the monitoring technology becomes more informative.

AB This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model of optimal taxation in which both private agents and the government can default on their debt. As a benchmark we consider Ramsey equilibria in which the government can precommit to its policies at the beginning of time, but in which private agents can default. We then consider sustainable equilibria in which both government and private agent decision rules are required to be sequentially rational. We adapt Abreu's (1988) optimal trigger strategies to completely characterize the entire set of sustainable equilibria. In particular, we show that when there is sufficiently little discounting and government consumption fluctuates enough, the Ramsey allocations and policies (in which the government never defaults) can be supported by a sustainable equilibrium. By way of an example we show that the larger the variance of government consumption the easier it is to support good outcomes. We also show for moderate discount factors that in the best sustainable equilibrium, tax rates are more volatile and debt is smaller than in the Ramsey equilibrium.

ID MODELS; EXPECTATIONS; CONVERGENCE
AB This paper studies the stability of competitive equilibria in a model of aggregate employment when the representative agent uses a least-squares forecasting procedure. It is shown that the Pareto inferior low employment steady state is always unstable under least-squares learning, even if it is stable under perfect foresight. The high employment steady state is stable under learning if and only if it is saddle point stable under perfect foresight. This weakens multiple equilibrium theories of coordination failure that purport to explain persistently high unemployment. The Pareto superior high employment steady state will be the focal point of individual forecasting.

AB We investigate the consequences of imposing additivity on community preferences. We show that there are important implications of additive community preferences that are not implied by the additivity of a single consumer's preferences. In particular, we show that imposing additivity on community preferences implies the existence of a representative consumer with a utility function in the CES family. We demonstrate the restrictive nature of these implications with three examples. Our interpretation of the results is that single consumer models are unable to adequately represent important features of multi-consumer economies.

AB We apply the White information matrix (IM) test to the linear regression model with autocorrelated errors. A special case of one component of the test is found to be identical to the Engle Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Given Chesher's interpretation of the IM test as a test for parameter heterogeneity, this establishes a connection among the IM test, ARCH and parameter variation. This also enables us to specify conditional heteroskedasticity in a more general and convenient way. Other interesting by-products of our analysis are tests for the variation in conditional and static skewness which we call tests for ''heterocliticity''.

We prove that the results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984) can be generalized to multi-spell models with lagged duration dependence. We also prove that without lagged duration dependence, the identification result does not depend on moment conditions or tail conditions on the mixing distribution. This result is in contrast to Ridder's (1990) result for single-spell models.

AB Using data collected by the authors on the largest and most durable of worker-owned firms in U.S. manufacturing, this paper is addressed to two questions. First, are the responses of cooperatives to changes in their economic environment different from those of conventional firms? It appears that cooperatives are more inclined to adjust pay than employment. Second, how profitable has membership in the cooperatives been? Using information on share prices, we find membership to have been extremely profitable, and in this sense, the prices of co-ops' shares have been underpriced. The riskiness of cooperative membership is discussed.

AB The Federal Trade Commission's action to eliminate basing-point pricing in the softwood plywood industry during the mid-1970's created a natural experiment. I find that the FTC's action had no effect on the delivered price of the base-site product (Douglas fir plywood) but decreased the delivered price of the non-base-site product (pine plywood) for many consumers. The evidence suggests that the detrimental effects of basing-point pricing for economic welfare were reflected entirely in the behavior of non-base-site firms.

Results indicate a statistically significant impact of the level of monetary incentives on revealed risk preferences. However, even under extreme monetary incentives, subjects demanded amounts well in excess of expected value for low-probability gain prospects.

These models recognize that observed ideology may influence legislative behavior but do not correct for unobserved ideology. This study devises new tests for logrolling and ideology. The empirical model controls for logroll agreements and unobserved ideological interest via the correlation of unobserved variables. The results reflect the presence of vote-trading coalitions on some votes but not on others. The results cast doubt on the importance of personal ideological interests of legislators.

Assuming altruistically motivated transfers in at least some family lines and other plausible conditions, we prove the invariance of capital's steady-state marginal product to government debt, government expenditures, and the tax rates on labor and capital income. We show that the tax treatment of household interest payments has powerful effects on capital intensity and aggregate savings in life-cycle and, especially, altruistic linkage models.

AB Search theory has been extensively and successfully applied to explain the persistence of price dispersion. This paper presents an explicitly dynamic search model which is able to account for cyclical patterns of prices and demand over time. These cyclical features of the model are the consequence of the dynamic strategic interaction between buyers and firms and do not require the presence of extraneous factors such as shocks or heterogeneity of agents in order to obtain. The model builds on earlier work by Kenneth Burdett and Kenneth L. Judd and may be interpreted as a dynamic extension of their model.

AB The deterioration of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the 1980's fell mostly on durable goods. Using a representative-agent model, we show that the key distinction between the trade balance in nondurables and durables is the role of intertemporal prices in the latter. A decrease in intertemporal prices associated, for example, with an exchange-rate overvaluation should therefore be expected to worsen the trade balance in durables more than in nondurables. This interpretation of the compositional changes of the U.S. trade balance is supported by our econometric findings.

AB This paper examines justifications of the rational-expectations hypothesis that rely on the analysis of the agents' mental forecasting ("educing") activity (which involves "forecasting the forecasts" of others, etc.). The corresponding concept of eductive learning stability, based on the game-theoretical concept of rationalizability, is primarily used within the classical Muth model. Conditions for coordination of beliefs are interpreted and discussed; they are robust to the introduction of noise. More generally, eductive stability fits economic intuition on coordination: stability increases when the industry product differentiation increases and when decisions are sequential and observable.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

AB The representative-agent framework has endowed macroeconomists with powerful microeconomic tools. Unfortunately, it has also blurred the distinction between statements that are valid at the individual level and those that apply to the aggregate. In this paper I argue that probability theory puts strong restrictions on the joint behavior of a large number of units that are less than fully synchronized. Many fallacies arise from disregarding these restrictions. For example, asymmetric factor adjustment costs at the firm level need not imply asymmetric responses of aggregate employment flows to positive and negative shocks.

ID COMPETITION; SPILLOVERS; DUOPOLY
AB We analyze the effects of R&D cartelization and research joint ventures on firms that engage in either Cournot or Bertrand competition in their product market. Research efforts, which precede production, are directed to reducing unit cost and are subject to various degrees of spillovers. It is shown that creating a competitive research joint venture reduces the equilibrium level of technological improvement and increases equilibrium prices compared to when firms conduct R&D independently. A research joint venture that cooperates in its R&D decisions yields the highest consumer plus producer surplus under Cournot competition and, in most cases, under Bertrand competition.

In the presence of sufficiently, large R&D spillovers, neither noncooperative nor cooperative equilibria achieve even second-best R&D levels. In the absence of spillover effects, however, while the cooperative R&D level remains socially insufficient, the noncooperative level may overshoot first- and second-best levels of R&D.

The optimal regulatory programs are shown to vary greatly, depending upon the information available to the regulator. The price of the basic service may optimally be distorted above or below marginal cost to better motivate the supply of the service enhancement. Our policy prescriptions are compared with current programs and proposals to promote energy conservation.

AB We argue that many goods and decisions are not allocated or made through markets. We interpret an agent's status as a ranking device that determines how well he or she fares in the nonmarket sector. The existence of a nonmarket sector can endogenously generate a concern for relative position in, for example, the income distribution so that higher income implies higher status. Moreover, it can naturally yield multiple equilibria. It is thus possible to explain differences in growth rates across countries without recourse to differences in underlying preferences, technologies, or endowments. Different social organizations lead to different reduced-form preferences, which lead to different growth rates.

ID INCREASING RETURNS
AB Recent theories of economic growth, including those of Romer, Porter, and Jacobs, have stressed the role of technological spillovers in generating growth. Because such knowledge spillovers are particularly effective in cities, where communication between people is more extensive, data on the growth of industries in different cities allow us to test some of these theories. Using a new data set on the growth of large industries in 170 U.S. cities between 1956 and 1987, we find that local competition and urban variety, but not regional specialization, encourage employment growth in industries. The evidence suggests that important knowledge spillovers might occur between rather than within industries, consistent with the theories of Jacobs.

We use methods similar to those of Kydland and Prescott to calibrate linearized versions of both our model and an analogous perfectly competitive model. We then compute the two models' predictions concerning the economy's responses to a change in military spending. The responses predicted by the oligopolistic model are closer to the empirical responses estimated with postwar U.S. data than the corresponding predictions of the competitive model.

AB We analyze a differential game in which all interest groups have access to a common capital stock. We show that the introduction of a technology that has inferior productivity but enjoys private access may ameliorate the tragedy of the commons. We use this model to analyze capital flight: in many poor countries, property rights are not well defined; since "safe" bank accounts in rich countries (the inferior technology) are available to citizens of these countries, they engage in capital flight. We show that the occurrence of capital flight does not imply that opening the capital account reduces growth and welfare.

AB Proper evaluation of cost-quality trade-offs inherent in regulatory policy requires identifying the structure of production from the behavioral response of quality to the policy change. However, estimating the structure of production with endogenous quality is difficult because of both measurement problems and data availability. We develop a simple method for identifying and estimating cost functions in the presence of endogenous and unobserved quality. Using this method, we estimate that a quality-adjusted cost function for nursing homes treating quality as exogenous yields seriously mis-leading estimates of marginal cost and economies of scale. We then used the parameter estimates to evaluate the cost-quality trade-off in nursing home regulatory policy.

Our point estimate is that none of the unrejected nulls in our sample is true. We reject the hypothesis that more than one-third are true. We consider three explanations for this finding: that all null hypotheses are mere approximations, that data-mining biases reported standard errors downward, and that journals tend to publish papers that fail to reject their null hypotheses only when the null hypotheses are likely to be false. While all these explanations are important, the last seems best able to explain our findings.

Then, the government creates a Federal Health Insurance System (HealthFed), modeled on the Federal Reserve System, to fill the role now played by the benefits office of a large firm. The HealthFed would create a short menu of alternatives, solicit bids for insuring the entire group, and price alternatives. There would be redistribution between groups and pricing of alternatives to reflect optimal social insurance principles. There would be no connection between health insurance and employment.

AB This paper provides an extension of Savage's subjective expected utility theory for decisions under uncertainty. It includes in the set of events both unambiguous events for which probabilities are additive and ambiguous events for which probabilities are permitted to be nonadditive. The main axiom is cumulative dominance, which adapts stochastic dominance to decision making under uncertainty. We derive a Choquet expected utility representation and show that a modification of cumulative dominance leads to the classical expected utility representation. The relationship of our approach with that of Schmeidler, who uses a two-stage formulation to derive Choquet expected utility, is also explored. Our work may be viewed as a unification of Schmeidler (1989) and Gilboa (1987).

AB Using a standard model of nonuniform pricing, properties are derived for both free entry and limited entry Bertrand equilibrium in nonuniform strategies. These properties follow from the feasibility of Bertrand undercutting with nonuniform prices. When there is free entry, zero-profit minimum average cost production occurs in equilibrium. If, in addition, average cost attains its minimum at any quantity below market output, all prices collapse to a uniform price equal to minimum average cost. A necessary condition for existence of this equilibrium is derived and compared to similar conditions from uniform price theory. Analogies to uniform price theory depend on the rationing capabilities of nonuniform prices and the rationing assumptions employed in uniform price models. Without free entry, prices may not collapse to a uniform price in equilibrium. Also, positive profit may occur but all firms must earn equal profit and incur equal marginal cost, while consumers pay average outlay no greater than marginal cost.

Under efficiency, the four axioms: individual rationality, resource monotonicity, population solidarity, and stand alone test, show little compatibility. However when the goods have enough substitutability in everyone's preferences, the Shapley value of the surplus sharing game satisfies all four axioms. An example is the optimal assignment of indivisible goods when every agent consumes only one good.

AB This paper develops a two-sector overlapping-generations model. It characterizes the dynamical system globally and establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of a globally unique perfect-foresight equilibrium. The paper provides therefore a useful framework for global dynamic analysis of phenomena whose modeling requires a multi-dimensional commodity space. The analysis demonstrates that gross substitutability in consumption is not sufficient to ensure the determinacy of equilibrium in this production economy. However, if in addition the investment good is capital intensive and second period consumption of two-period-lived individuals is a normal good, then the perfect-foresight equilibrium is globally unique. If the consumption good is capital intensive, global uniqueness does not hold despite the existence of gross substitutability and normality in consumption. The paper establishes in this case sufficient conditions for local determinacy, local indeterminacy, and global indeterminacy.

AB The existence and stability of invariant distributions tor stochaistically monotone processes is studied. The Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem is applied to establish existence of fixed points of mappings on Compact sets of measures that are increasing with respect to a stochastic ordering. Global convergence of a monotone Markov process to its unique invariant distribution is established under an easily verified assumption. Topkis' theory of supermodular functions is applied to stochastic dynamic optimization, providing conditions under which optimal stationary decisions are monotone functions of the state and induce a monotone Markov process. Applications of these results to investment theory, stochastic growth, and industry equilibrium dynamics are given.

AB This paper reports the results of a systematic experimental comparison of the effect of alternative arbitration systems on dispute rates. By using a common underlying distribution of arbitrator "fair" awards in the different arbitration systems we are able to compare dispute rates across different arbitration procedures while holding fixed the amount of objective uncertainty the bargainers face. The three main findings indicate that (1) dispute rates are inversely related to the monetary costs of disputes, (ii) the dispute rate in a final-offer arbitration system is at least as high as the dispute rate in a comparable conventional arbitration system, and (iii) dispute rates are inversely related to the uncertainty costs of disputes, indicating that some bargainers behave as if they were risk averse.

AB This paper considers specialization and the division of labor. A more extensive division of labor raises productivity because returns to the time spent on tasks are usually greater to workers who concentrate on a narrower range of skills. The traditional discussion of the division of labor emphasizes the limitations to specialization imposed by the extent of the market. We claim that the degree of specialization is more often determined by other considerations. Especially emphasized are various costs of "coordinating" specialized workers who perform complementary tasks, and the amount of general knowledge available.

TI DID THE DEBT CRISIS CAUSE THE INVESTMENT CRISIS
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID UNCERTAINTY; MODELS
AB There is now a large literature that attributes the investment decline in heavily indebted countries to the effects of the international debt crisis which began in 1982. However, these countries also faced falling export prices and high world real interest rates in the early 1980s, and these shocks could have directly caused investment to decline. One way to test for debt effects is to see whether equations without any debt-related information can nevertheless forecast the investment declines that these countries experienced. This paper shows that such equations can forecast investment in many indebted countries, and thus casts doubt on many debt-related explanations for the investment declines.

AB Teen childbearing is commonly believed to cause long-term socioeconomic disadvantages for mothers and their children. However, earlier cross-sectional studies may have inadequately accounted for marked differences in family background among women who have first births at different ages. We present new estimates that take into account unmeasured family background heterogeneity by comparing sisters who timed their first births at different ages. In two of the three data sets we examine, sister comparisons suggest that biases from family background heterogeneity are important, and, therefore, that earlier studies may have overstated the consequences of teen childbearing.

Data detailing how present expected compensation varies with the age of hire, therefore, embed information about how productivity varies with age. This paper infers age-productivity profiles using data on the present expected value of earnings of new hires of a Fortune 1000 firm. For each of the five occupation/sex groups considered, productivity fails with age, with productivity exceeding earnings when young and vice versa when old.

AB In a neoclassical growth model, it is possible to make a case for public debt, because a balanced growth path may be dynamically inefficient. This paper shows that this possibility no longer holds in an endogenous growth model with constant external returns to capital. It is shown that an increase in public debt reduces the growth rate, so there always exists a future generation that will be harmed, and that a reduction in public debt, although it increases the growth rate, cannot be Pareto-improving: one current generation must be harmed.

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that positive money-supply shocks do not have an effect on output, while negative money-supply shocks do have an effect on output. This finding is independent of whether or not expected money is assumed to affect output. The results reported in this paper imply that the Fed could increase the growth rate of real output by reducing the standard deviation of unexpected changes in the money supply.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Comparing two countries in which the poor have equal real incomes, the one in which the rich are wealthier is likely to have a higher infant mortality rate. This anomalous result does not appear to spring from measurement error in estimating the income of the poor, and the association between high infant mortality and income inequality is still present after controlling for other factors such as education, medical personnel, and fertility. The positive association of infant mortality and the income of the rich suggests that measured real incomes may be a poor measure of social welfare.

This study also examines whether the ability of aggregate insider trading to predict future stock returns can be attributed to changes in business conditions or movements away from fundamentals. Evidence suggests that both explanations contribute to the predictive ability of aggregate insider trading.

AB An increase in margin requirements in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange is followed by a decline in margin borrowing, trading volume, the proportion of trading performed through margin accounts, the growth in stock prices, and the conditional volatility of daily returns. The nonmarginable Second Section stocks show a smaller change in volatility and only a delayed weak price response. The hypothesis that margin requirements restrict the behavior of destabilizing speculators can explain these correlations but cannot explain the observation that individuals, the most active users of margin funds, appear to be good market timers.

The key mechanism is a thin market externality that reduces the supply of jobs when the duration of unemployment increases. The paper develops an overlapping-generations model of search equilibrium and shows that different patterns of persistence and multiple equilibria are possible even with constant returns production and matching technologies.

AB We use trends in self-reported disability to gauge the impact of the growth of disability transfer programs on the labor force attachment of older working-aged men. Our tabulations suggest that between 1949 and 1987, about half of the 4.9 percentage point drop in the labor force participation of men aged 45-54 and between one quarter and one third of the 19.9 point drop among men aged 55-64 represented a movement of men out of the labor force and onto the rolls of transfer programs targeted at the disabled. Since the expansion of transfer programs represents only one of the forces behind this movement, these figures represent upper bounds on the impact of such programs on work force attachment.

AB Sanctions are measures that one party (the sender) uses to influence another (the target). Sanctions, or the threat of sanctions, have been used by governments to alter the human rights, trade, or foreign policies of other governments. We develop notions of the sender's and target's toughness that depend on their patience and on the extent of their suffering from sanctions. How much a sender can exact from the target depends on the relative toughness of the two. Sanctions that impose less harm on the target can sometimes be more effective than those that impose greater harm.

TI COMPETITION IN THE BRITISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

AB Most of the British electricity supply industry has been privatized, Two dominant generators supply bulk electricity to an unregulated "pool." They submit a supply schedule of prices for generation and receive the market-clearing price, which varies with demand. Despite claims that this should be highly competitive, we show that the Nash equilibrium in supply schedules implies a high markup on marginal cost and substantial deadweight losses. Further simulations, to show the effect of entry by 1994, produce somewhat lower prices, at the cost of excessive entry; subdividing the generators into five firms would produce better results.

AB We present models in which price discrimination in the context of a two-part price can occur in some competitive markets. Purchases take place in groups, which choose which firms to patronize. While firms are perfectly competitive with respect to groups, they have some market power over individual consumers, who are constrained by their groups' choices. We find that firms will charge an entry fee that is below marginal cost, and the second part of the price is marked up above marginal cost. The markup not only is positive but increases with the quality of the product.

ID SCHOOLS
AB Individuals or households often have some scope for choice of peer groups, whether through the selection of neighborhood of residence, school, or friends. This study addresses the estimation of peer group effects in cases in which measures of peer group influence are potentially endogenous variables. Using a rich data set on individual behavior, the paper explores teenage pregnancy and school dropout behavior. For both cases, the estimation of a straight-forward single-equation model yields statistically significant peer group effects; however, these effects disappear under simultaneous equation estimation. The results are robust and suggest the need for careful modeling of the choice of peer groups.

Ogaki and Park's cointegration approach is used to estimate parameters of the utility function from time-series data. Total expenditure elasticities implied by the estimated addilog utility function are compared with estimates of the elasticities from cross-sectional data.

AB This paper examines the credit rationing debate using detailed contract information on over one million commercial bank loans from 1977 to 1988. While commercial loan rates are "sticky," consistent with rationing, this stickiness varies with loan contract terms in ways that are not predicted by equilibrium credit rationing theory. In addition, the proportion of new loans issued under commitment does not increase significantly when credit markets are tight, despite the fact that borrowers without commitments can be rationed whereas commitment borrowers are contractually insulated from rationing. Overall, the data suggest that equilibrium rationing is not a significant macroeconomic phenomenon.

SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

ID LONG-RUN GROWTH; INCREASING RETURNS
AB The recent literature on endogenous economic growth allows for effects of fiscal policy on long-term growth. If the social rate of return on investment exceeds the private return, then tax policies that encourage investment can raise the growth rate and levels of utility. An excess of the social return over the private return can reflect learning-by-doing with spillover effects, the financing of government consumption purchases with an income tax, and monopoly pricing of new types of capital goods. Tax incentives for investment are not called for if the private rate of return on investment equals the social return. This situation applies in growth models if the accumulation of a broad concept of capital does not entail diminishing returns, or if technological progress appears as an expanding variety of consumer products.
   In growth models that incorporate public services, the optimal tax policy hinges on the characteristics of the services. If the public services are publicly-provided private goods, which are rival and excludable, or publicly-provided public goods, which are non-rival and non-excludable, then lump-sum taxation is superior to income taxation. Many types of public goods are subject to congestion, and are therefore rival but to some extent non-excludable. In these cases, income taxation works approximately as a user fee and can therefore be superior to lump-sum taxation. In particular, the incentives for investment and growth are too high if taxes are lump sum. We argue that the congestion model applies to a wide array of public expenditures, including transportation facilities, public utilities, courts, and possibly national defence and police.
