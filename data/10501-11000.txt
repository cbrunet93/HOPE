AB Spatial separation of racial and ethnic groups may theoretically have positive or negative effects on the economic performance of those groups. We examine the effects of segregation on outcomes for blacks in schooling, employment, and single parenthood. We find that blacks in more segregated areas have significantly worse outcomes than blacks in less segregated areas. We control for the endogeneity of location choice using instruments based on political factors, topographical features, and residence before adulthood. A one standard deviation decrease in segregation would eliminate one-third of the black-white differences in most of our outcomes.

AB We develop a theory of labor contracting in which negative productivity shocks lead to costly job loss, despite unlimited possibilities for renegotiating wage contracts. Such fragile contracts emerge from firms' trade-offs between robustness of incentives in ongoing employment relationships and costly specific investment. Contractual fragility can serve as a powerful mechanism for propagating underlying productivity shocks: in a simulated matching market equilibrium, i.i.d. shocks are greatly magnified in their effect on market output, and the effect is highly persistent. We also explore novel motivations for government policies that strengthen employment relationships.

AB The recent decline in the unemployment insurance (UI) takeup rate has puzzled researchers. Using administrative data with accurate information on the potential level and duration of benefits, we examine whether a separating employee receives UI. We find a strong positive effect of the benefit level on takeup, and smaller effects of the potential duration and the tax treatment of benefits. Simulations indicate that the recent inclusion of UI in the income tax base can account for most of the previously unexplained decline in UI receipt.

ID DIVISION; LABOR
AB This paper analyzes the evolution of an economy where growth is driven by increased specialization caused by the geographical expansion of markets. It proves that such Smithian growth exhibits generic threshold behavior. Below a critical density of transport linkages, the economy is split into isolated local markets with limited specialization. Above the critical density, these markets begin to fuse into a large, economywide market causing growth to accelerate. This allows an explicit test of the consensus among historians of Sung dynasty China that the economic revolution during that period was a result of commercialization caused by the creation of a national waterway network.

AB The act of choosing can have particular relevance in maximizing behavior for at least two distinct reasons: (1) process significance (preferences may be sensitive to the choice process, including the identity of the chooser), and (2) decisional inescapability (choices may have to be made whether or not the judgemental process has been completed). The general approach of maximizing behavior can - appropriately formulated - accommodate both concerns, but the regularities of choice behavior assumed in standard models of rational choice will need significant modification. These differences have considerable relevance in studies of economic, social, and political behavior.

ID HEALTH-INSURANCE; OLDER MEN; CONSUMPTION; DECISION; MODEL
AB This paper provides an empirical analysis of how the U.S. Social Security and Medicare insurance system affects the labor supply of older males in the presence of incomplete markets for loans, annuities, and health insurance. We estimate a dynamic programming (DP) model of the joint labor supply and Social Security acceptance decision, focusing on a sample of males in the low to middle income brackets whose only pension is Social Security. The DP model delivers a rich set of predictions about the dynamics of retirement behavior, and comparisons of actual vs. predicted behavior show that the DP model is able to account for a wide variety of phenomena observed in the data, including the pronounced peaks in the distribution of retirement ages at 62 and 65 (the ages of early and normal eligibility for Social Security benefits, respectively). We identify a significant fraction of ''health insurance constrained'' individuals who have no form of retiree health insurance other than Medicare, and who can only obtain fairly priced private health insurance via their employer's group health plan. The combination of significant individual risk aversion and a long tailed (Pareto) distribution of health care expenditures implies that there is a significant ''security value'' for these individuals to remain employed until they are eligible for Medicare coverage at age 65. Overall, our model suggests that a number of heretofore puzzling aspects of retirement behavior can be viewed as artifacts of particular details of the Social Security rules, whose incentive effects are especially strong for lower income individuals and those who do not have access to fairly priced loans, annuities, and health insurance.

DE contract enforcement; reciprocity; moral hazard; principal agent theory
ID FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR
AB Numerous experimental studies indicate that people tend to reciprocate favors and punish unfair behavior. It is hypothesized that these behavioral responses contribute to the enforcement of contracts and, hence, increase gains from trade. It turns out that if only one side of the market has opportunities for reciprocal responses, the impact of reciprocity on contract enforcement depends on the details of the pecuniary incentive system. If both sides of the market have opportunities for reciprocal responses, robust and powerful reciprocity effects occur. In particular, reciprocal behavior causes a substantial increase in the set of enforceable actions and, hence, large efficiency gains.

AB While optimally weighted GMM estimation has desirable large sample properties, its small sample performance is poor in some applications. We propose a computationally simple alternative, for weakly dependent data generating mechanisms, based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion. Conditions are derived under which the large sample properties of this estimator are similar to GMM, i.e., the estimator will be consistent and asymptotically normal, with the same asymptotic covariance matrix as GMM. In addition, we propose overidentifying and parametric restrictions tests as alternatives to analogous GMM procedures.

We analyze instead a mechanism design problem in which the agents can communicate between themselves and collude under asymmetric information. We characterize the set of implementable collusion-proof contracts both when the principal offers anonymous and nonanonymous contracts. After having isolated the nexi and the stakes of collusion we proceed to a normative analysis, perform some comparative statics, discuss our concept of collusion-proofness, and provide some insights about transaction costs in side contracting.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB To obtain consistency and asymptotic normality, a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator typically is defined to be an approximate global minimizer of a GMM criterion function. To compute such an estimator, however, can be problematic because of the difficulty of global optimization. In consequence, practitioners usually ignore the problem and take the GMM estimator to be the result of a local optimization algorithm. This yields an estimator that is not necessarily consistent and asymptotically normal. The use of a local optimization algorithm also can run into the problem of instability due to flats or ridges in the criterion function, which makes it difficult to know when to stop the algorithm.
   To alleviate these problems of global and local optimization, we propose a stopping-rule (SR) procedure for computing GMM estimators. The SR procedure eliminates the need for global search with high probability. And, it provides an explicit SR for problems of stability that may arise with local optimization problems.

ID ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY; NONPARAMETRIC MODELS; REGRESSION
AB This paper presents a procedure for analyzing a model in which the parameter vector has two parts: a finite-dimensional component theta and a nonparametric component lambda. The procedure does not require parametric modeling of lambda but assumes that the true density of the data satisfies an index restriction. The idea is to construct a parametric model passing through the true model and to estimate theta by setting the score for the parametric model to zero. The score is estimated nonparametrically and the estimator is shown to be root N consistent and asymptotically normal. The estimator is then shown to attain the semiparametric efficiency bound characterized in Begun et al. (1983) for multivariate nonlinear regression, simultaneous equations, partially specified regression, index regression, censored regression, switching regression, and disequilibrium models in which the error densities are unknown.

No stocks are held at a monetary loss in terms of local prices. Any apparent loss is an illusion from spatial aggregation of stocks and attribution of incentives at one locality to storers at all locations. Moreover, as the premium for immediate delivery at the port rises, stocks increase at relatively inaccessible, inconvenient locations where prices are low, allowing more to be shipped from locations more convenient to the port.

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INCENTIVES
AB We present a hold-up model of investment where active industrial policy promotes both corruption and investment. Since corruption deters investment, the effect of industrial policy on investment is lower than when corruption is absent. We find evidence suggesting that corruption is indeed higher in countries pursuing active industrial policies. Policy implications are illustrated by decomposing the total effect of industrial policy into a positive, direct effect, and a negative, corruption-induced effect. In the presence of corruption, the total effect of industrial policy on investment ranges between 84 and 56% of the direct impact. The magnitude of these corrections suggests that corruption considerations should not be absent from cost-benefit analyses of industrial policies.

TI A constitution for knaves crowds out civic virtues
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB When discussing constitutional design, economists concentrate on the propensity of individuals to free ride. Preventing opportunistic behaviour by knaves has costs by crowding out civic virtue. Another view emphasises active citizen participation in order to bolster civic virtue. A viable constitution must therefore be strict enough to deter exploitative behaviour. At the same time, the constitution should fundamentally convey trust towards its citizens and politicians. Distrusting public laws risk destroying the positive attitude of citizens and politicians towards the state. Civic virtue can be maintained and fostered by direct citizen participation via popular referenda and initiatives.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB In order to be able to conduct a test of the (core) utility hypothesis that is not confounded with tests of (subsidiary) hypotheses that economic agents all have the same preferences and that their preferences are weakly separable, it is necessary to use data that are disaggregated and complete. In order to carry out a utility hypothesis test with complete data, revealed preference theory must first be extended. The generalised axiom of revealed preference is extended to include labour supply and portfolio choice. Then a complete, disaggregated data set is used to test the utility hypothesis and two preference separability hypotheses.

ID PREFERENCE REVERSAL
AB The Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism is used in experimental economics as an incentive-compatible procedure for eliciting reservation prices. It is found here, where seller prices are elicited, that the mechanism is sensitive to the choice of upper bound of the randomly generated buyout prices. Hence, the mechanism cannot be generally incentive compatible in practice. Two ways to specify the upper bound are identified which make the BDM mechanism yield mean seller prices that do not differ from those generated in an incentive-compatible market. The experimental market used here is designed so that traders are unable to influence transaction prices, even when the market is small.

AB Probabilistic choices or 'choice errors' may play an important supporting role in shaping observed risky choices, and a variety of restrictions on such choice probabilities play the role of identifying restrictions in empirical decision research. We test six restrictions in the context of common ratio effect data for a general class of theories of risky choice. Two restrictions, one for aggregate and one for individual data, are supported. But none of the heterogeneity restrictions that make the aggregate data model powerful survive scrutiny; nor do estimable parametric versions of the individual data model. There is room for new stochastic identifying restrictions in empirical decision research.

AB We use an irreversible investment model of oil development to show how a fiscal regime can be both neutral with respect to development decisions and efficient in recouping economic rents. We find that there is a unique rate for calculating the tax deductibility of capital costs which ensures economic neutrality; while tax efficiency involves high rates of tax on profits after these deductions. Using parameters of the UK Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), numerical calculations in our simplified model suggest that PRT was both neutral and relatively efficient. In conclusion the tax efficiency of PRT is compared with that of a neutral resource rent tax.

We examine how child school attendance responds to seasonal fluctuations in the income of agrarian households using panel data from rural India. To pinpoint market imperfections, we study responses to aggregate and idiosyncratic, as well as to anticipated and unanticipated, income shocks. Our main finding is that seasonal fluctuations in school attendance are a form of self-insurance, but one which does not result in a substantial loss of human capital on average.

We assume that signals are private information and commitment to monitoring is not possible. We show that delegation of monitoring is profitable. With delegation the principal can better regulate incentives (incentive-effect) and commit to a broader range of wage structures (commitment effect). We introduce collusion to find an endogenous bound on rewards and show that collusion limits the commitment-effect, but due to the incentive-effect delegation remains profitable.

AB In this paper I discuss alternatives to the GMM estimators proposed by Hansen (1982) and others. These estimators are shown to have a number of advantages. First of all, there is no need to estimate in an initial step a weight matrix as required in the conventional estimation procedure. Second, it is straightforward to derive the distribution of the estimator under general misspecification. Third, some of the alternative estimators have appealing information-theoretic interpretations. in particular, one of the estimators is an empirical likelihood estimator with an interpretation as a discrete support maximum likelihood estimator. Fourth, in an empirical example one of the new estimators is shown to perform better than the conventional estimators. Finally, the new estimators make it easier for the researcher to get better approximations to their distributions using saddlepoint approximations. The main cost is computational: the system of equations that has to be solved is of greater dimension than the number of parameters of interest. In practice this may or may not be a problem in particular applications.

The implication on hypothesis testing is also discussed. It is shown that in a structural equation approach what one needs to worry about are the classical issues of identification and estimation, not nonstationarity and cointegration. Conventional formulae for computing the asymptotic covariance of the 2SLS estimator and the Wald-type test statistics remain good approximations despite the fact that variables may be integrated.

Our simplification is obtained by closely following the steps by which probabilities and utilities are elicited.

For a class of economies which can be expressed in terms of a real valued characteristic function, we first show that all self-perpetuating allocations realized from a simple bargaining game must be core allocations although players make simultaneous demands for surplus and only on their own behalf. Following this, we provide a sufficient condition under which the society eventually learns to divide the surplus according to some core allocation, regardless of the initial history.

As a result, investments in general skills will be suboptimally low, and contrary to the standard theory, part of the costs may be borne by the employers. The paper also demonstrates that the interaction between innovation and training reads to an amplification of this inefficiency and to a multiplicity of equilibria. Workers are more willing to invest in their skills by accepting lower wages today if they expect more firms to innovate and pay them higher wages in the future. Similarly, firms are more willing to innovate when they expect the quality of the future workforce to be higher, thus when workers invest more in their skills.

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; INDIVISIBLE LABOR; MONEY; MODEL
AB We use a dynamic general equilibrium model to obtain quantitative estimates of the welfare cost of nominal wage contracting. We find that the welfare cost of such contracts can vary quite a lot depending on the degree of indexation, the size and persistence of monetary shocks and the contract length. The size and persistence of technology shocks do not affect the welfare cost significantly. The elasticity of labour supply is important for the welfare cost. If the labour supply elasticity is small the welfare cost of nominal wage contracts can be substantial.

ID CENSORED-DATA; REGRESSION
AB Evidence from the Boston condominium market of the early 1990's reveals that an owner's equity position determines his experience as a seller. An owner of a property with a high loan-to-value ratio sets a higher asking price, has a higher expected time on the market and, if he sells, receives a higher price than an owner with proportionately less debt. The down payment requirement for purchasers, but not incumbent owners, provides a simple explanation for this phenomenon among owner-occupants. The results provide supporting evidence for equity-based aggregate theories of price-volume movements in the housing market. (JEL R31, D83)

AB Previous empirical studies have uncovered little evidence that police reduce crime, possibly due to simultaneity problems. This paper uses the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial elections as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime. Increases in the size of police forces are shown to be disproportionately concentrated in mayoral and gubernatorial election years. Increases in police are shown to substantially reduce violent crime, but have a smaller impact on property crime. The null hypothesis that the marginal social benefit of reduced crime equals the costs of hiring additional police cannot be rejected. (JEL K42, D72)

Our results can be characterized by three facts: (1) history matters; how a group performs in one incentive scheme depends on its history together under the scheme that preceded it; (2) relative performance schemes outperform target-based schemes; and (3) monitoring can elicit high effort from workers, but the probability of monitoring must be high and, therefore, costly.

AB The role that investment-specific technological change played in generating postwar U.S. growth is investigated here. The premise is that the introduction of new, more efficient capital goods is an important source of productivity change, and an attempt is made to disentangle its effects from the more traditional Hicks-neutral form of technological progress. The balanced growth path for the model is characterized and calibrated to U.S. National income and Product Account (NIPA) data. The quantitative analysis suggests that investment-specific technological change accounts for the major part of growth. (JEL E13, 030, 041, 047)

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between technological progress, wage inequality, intergenerational earnings mobility, and economic growth. In periods of major technological inventions, a decline in the relative importance of initial conditions raises inequality, enhances mobility, and generates a larger concentration of high-ability individuals in technologically advanced sectors, stimulating future technological progress and growth. However, once technologies become more accessible, mobility is diminished and inequality decreases bur becomes more persistent. The reduction in the concentration of ability in technologically advanced sectors diminishes the likelihood of technological breakthroughs and slows future growth. User friendliness, therefore, becomes unfriendly to future economic growth. (JEL D31, J31, J62, 040)

This result stands in sharp contrast with that of the one-sector neoclassical growth model, where both preferences and technologies determine the speed of convergence to a steady-state growth path.

The reason is that investors, anticipating liberal trade, will invest in the export sector, making the small country dependent on trade with the large one and thus ruining its bargaining power. This effect is dominated by conventional effects, so that anticipated bargaining benefits the small country on balance, if there is sufficient: (i) dissimilarity between the economies, and (ii) substitutability between goods.

We test the HOV model with international and Japanese regional data. The strict HOV model performs poorly because it cannot explain the international location of production. Restricting the sample to Japanese regions provides no help, inter alia giving rise to what Daniel Trefler calls the ''mystery of the missing trade.'' However, when we relax the assumption of universal factor price equalization, results improve dramatically. In sum, the HOV model performs remarkably well. (JEL F11, F14, R13)

This paper argues that exchange rate movements may affect acquisition FDI because acquisitions involve firm-specific assets which can generate returns in currencies other than that used for purchase. Using data on Japanese acquisitions in the United States across 3-digit SIC industries from 1975-1992, maximum-likelihood estimates from discrete dependent variable models support the hypothesis that real dollar depreciations make Japanese acquisitions more likely in U.S. industries, particularly those which more likely have firm-specific assets.

AB The policies used by Britain to finance World War II represented a dramatic departure from the policies used to finance earlier wars and were very different from the policies used by the United States during the war. Following Keynes's recommendations, Britain taxed capital income at a much higher rate than the United States during the war and for much of the postwar period. We analyze quantitatively the policies designed by Keynes using an endogenous growth model and the neoclassical growth model. We also evaluate the implications of tax-smoothing policies. We find that the welfare costs of Keynes's policies were very high relative to a tax-smoothing policy and argue that Britain's poor macroeconomic performance in the early postwar period is a consequence of the high tax rates levied on capital income.

AB This paper provides structural estimates of a dynamic model of schooling, work, and occupational choice decisions based on II years of observations on a sample of young men from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY). The structural estimation framework that we adopt fully imposes the restrictions of the theory and permits an investigation of whether such a theoretically restricted model can succeed in quantitatively fitting the observed data patterns. We find that a suitably extended human capital investment model can in fact do an excellent job of fitting observed data on school attendance, work, occupational choices, and wages in the NLSY data on young men and also produces reasonable forecasts of future work decisions and wage patterns.

AB It is well known that comparative performance information (CPI) can enhance efficiency in static principal-agent relationships by improving the trade-off between insurance and incentives in the design of explicit contracts. In dynamic settings, however, there may be implicit as well as explicit incentives, for example, managerial career concerns and the ratchet effect in regulation. We show that the dynamic effects of CPI on implicit incentives can either reinforce or oppose the familiar (static) insurance effect and in either case can be more important for efficiency. The overall welfare effects of CPI are thus ambiguous and can be characterized in terms of the underlying information structure.

AB Economic development is typically accompanied by migration from rural to urban employment. This migration is often associated with significant urban underemployment. Both factors are important in the development process. We consider a neoclassical growth model with rural-urban migration and urban underemployment, which arises from an adverse selection problem in labor markets. We demonstrate that rural-urban migration and underemployment can be a source of development traps and can give rise to a large set of periodic equilibria displaying undamped oscillation. Many such equilibria display long periods of uninterrupted growth, punctuated by brief but severe recessions.

TI Are hypothetical referenda incentive compatible?
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
AB Hypothetical referenda have been proposed as an incentive-compatible mechanism that can be used to obtain social valuations of environmental resources. We employ experimental methods to test the hypothesis that such referenda are indeed incentive compatible. Our results lead us to reject that hypothesis.

TI The role of markets in reducing expected utility violations
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Market theorists assume that expected utility predicts preferences at the market level even as evidence mounts that it predicts poorly at the individual level. The arguments for better-performing markets are grounded in the assumption that individuals respond to the competition of the market. The objective of this study is to test empirically the validity of those assumptions using the betweenness property of expected utility. I conclude that expected utility does indeed predict better in markets, but analyses suggest that improved performance may be due to the statistical role played by markets introduced by market price selection rules.

AB This paper introduces random versions of successive approximations and multigrid algorithms for computing approximate solutions to a class of finite and infinite horizon Markovian decision problems (MDPs). We prove that these algorithms succeed in breaking the ''curse of dimensionality'' for a subclass of MDPs known as discrete decision processes (DDFs).

AB The strategy method asks experienced subjects to program strategies for a game. This paper reports on an application to a 20-period supergame of an asymmetric Cournot duopoly. The final strategies after three programming rounds show a typical structure. Typically, no expectations are formed and nothing is optimized. Instead of this, fairness criteria are used to determine cooperative goals, called ''ideal points.'' The subjects try to achieve cooperation by a ''measure-for-measure policy,'' which reciprocates movements towards and away from the ideal point by similar movements. A strategy tends to be more successful the more typical it is.

AB This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for single-equation instrumental variables regression when the partial correlations between the instruments and the endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to zero. Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including mio-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8% and 10%, with a typical 95% confidence interval of (5%, 15%).

AB Virtually all applications of time-varying conditional variance models use a quasi-maximum-likelihood estimator (QMLE). Consistency of a QMLE requires an identification condition that the quasi-log-likelihood have a unique maximum at the true conditional mean and relative scale parameters. We show that the identification condition holds for a non-Gaussian QMLE if the conditional mean is identically zero or if a symmetry condition is satisfied. Without symmetry, an additional parameter, for the location of the innovation density, must be added for identification. We calculate the efficiency loss from adding such a parameter under symmetry, when the parameter is not needed. We also show that there is no efficiency loss for the conditional variance parameters of a GARCH process.

AB The literature on the aggregation of (S, s) policies has ignored the impact of aggregate behavior on the individual's optimization problem. In the case of pricing, the feedback effects are clear. Not only do pricing strategies determine the evolution of the price level, but the evolution of the price level also influences the optimal pricing strategies. In this paper, we provide a consistent treatment of aggregation and optimization. We use this model to analyze three issues in the menu cost pricing literature: the relationship between strategic complementarity and the real effects of money; the relationship between the variance of the money supply and the correlation between money and output; and the relationship between the cost of price adjustment and the size of price adjustment.

AB Misspecification tests for parametric models, f(y, theta), that examine data for failure of moment conditions implied by the maintained parametric distribution are interpreted as score tests of H-0: lambda = 0 in the context of a parametric family of distributions r(y; theta, lambda). This family contains the maintained distribution as a special case (lambda = 0) and has the property that only in that special case do the chosen moment conditions hold. A likelihood ratio test of H-0: lambda = 0 therefore constitutes an alternative test of the validity of the moment conditions. This test admits a Bartlett correction, unlike conventional moment tests for which adjustments based on second order asymptotic theory may behave badly. The dependence of the Bartlett correction and of the O(n(-1/2)) local power of the test on the way in which r(y; theta, lambda) is constructed is studied. In many cases the correction can be made to vanish leading to a specification test whose distribution is chi-square to order O-p((n-2)).

A basic framework linking the multiple time series model and the dynamic simultaneous equation model is provided and implications under the long-run cointegrating relations are discussed. Conditions for identifying both the short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium conditions are given. Limiting properties of the least squares and simultaneous equation estimators under cointegration are derived. Implications for hypothesis testing are also discussed.

It also finds that the saving motives of Japanese households vary greatly by age and that they save at each life stage for motives that are appropriate for that life stage. These findings suggest that the life-cycle model is highly applicable in the case of Japan.

AB Signalling models are studied using experiments and adaptive learning models in an entry limit pricing game. Even though high cost monopolists never play dominated strategies, the easier it is ibr other players to recognise that these strategies are dominated, the more likely play is to converge to the undominated separating equilibrium and the more rapidly limit pricing develops. This is inconsistent with the equilibrium refinements literature (including Cho-Kreps' intuitive criterion) and pure (Bayesian) adaptive learning models. An augmented adaptive learning model in which some players recognise the existence of dominated strategies and their consequences predicts these outcomes.

Our labels treatments investigate the abstraction assumptions that underlie the concept of a strategy, while our population treatments investigate the attraction of alternative mutually consistent ways to play under adaptive behaviour. We observe conventions emerging in communities with one population and labels and with two populations and no labels, but the most effective treatment is two labelled populations. We estimate logistic response learning models for individual subject behaviour. Of the models considered, a version of exponential fictitious play fits our data best.

AB In Cournot oligopoly the efficiency of a firm relative to others determines its market share: this relationship gives an incentive to improve efficiency. The incentives are greater in markets where firm' behaviour is more competitive. Components of firm efficiency are identified by frontier production function techniques in r9 UK manufacturing sectors: technical change, average efficiency of each firm relative to the frontier, and the efficiency of each firm relative to its own 'best practice' in each period. Short run declines in market shares and profits induce the firm to improve efficiency relative to its 'best practice'. Long run differences in efficiency are correlated with differences in gross investment.

This demand cannot be deduced on purely theoretical grounds, but rather should be registered case by case. Theory might help in categorising classes of situations where decisions can be tackled with the same approach. In any case, the choice of a decision-mechanism should not be left completely at the discretion of the policy-maker if the citizens's welfare is to be promoted in a suitable way.

In this paper we show that even the simplest model of global warming does not satisfy either of Epstein's (1980) sufficient conditions, so it is not possible to use Epstein's analysis to tell whether the irreversibility effect applies to models of global warming. We derive an alternative sufficient condition for the irreversibility effect to hold.

The main aim is to examine what has happened to the relationship between unionisation and profitability after the changes in the union legislation, competition environment and cyclical variations that took place over this period. The impact of different forms of union-firm bargaining on the union-profitability effect is also examined. The data reveal that the negative union effect on profitability exists, even after controlling for firm specific fixed effects, but that it has been sharply reduced over the 1980s.

It is demonstrated that given the usual magnitude of a proposed Tobin tax, the deterrent to short-term speculation will be negligible and in all likelihood smaller than the deterrent to real trade flows and arbitrage activities. Finally, an alternative proposal for preventing currency speculations while creating incentives for global full employment, based on Keynes's 1940s writings, is proposed.

SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

DT Article
AB This paper employs an optimal taxation framework in order to study the credibility of monetary policy-making in an open economy. Since inflation is, in part, uncontrollable due to stochastic disturbances, the authority's actions cannot be monitored perfectly when the exchange rate floats, thus implying that reputational forces may become ineffective. In contrast, pegging the nominal exchange rate to a low-inflation currency allows perfect monitoring, because the exchange rate is, in principle, controllable. For this reason, exchange rate pegging may import credibility and result in the best reputational equilibrium, even though the authority retains the discretion to devalue unexpectedly.

ID PREFERENCE; WELFARE
AB Two core meanings of ''utility'' are distinguished. ''Decision utility'' is the weight of an outcome in a decision. ''Experienced utility'' is hedonic quality, as in Bentham's usage. Experienced utility can be reported in real time (instant utility), or in retrospective evaluations of past episodes (remembered utility). Psychological research has documented systematic errors in retrospective evaluations, which can induce a preference for dominated options. We propose a formal normative theory of the total experienced utility of temporally extended outcomes. Measuring the experienced utility of outcomes permits tests of utility maximization and opens other lines of empirical research.

AB Life-cycle models of labor supply predict a positive relationship between hours supplied and transitory changes in wages. We tested this prediction using three samples of wages and hours of New York City cabdrivers, whose wages are correlated within days but uncorrelated between days. Estimated wage elasticities are significantly negative in two out of three samples. Elasticities of inexperienced drivers average approximately -1 and are less than zero in all three samples (and significantly less than for experienced drivers in two of three samples). Our interpretation of these findings is that cabdrivers (at least inexperienced ones): (i) make labor supply decisions ''one day at a time'' instead of intertemporally substituting labor and leisure across multiple days, and (ii) set a loose daily income target and quit working once they reach that target.

AB Hyperbolic discount functions induce dynamically inconsistent preferences, implying a motive for consumers to constrain their own future choices. This paper analyzes the decisions of a hyperbolic consumer who has access to an imperfect commitment technology: an illiquid asset whose sale must be initiated one period before the sale proceeds are received. The model predicts that consumption tracks income, and the model explains why consumers have asset-specific marginal propensities to consume. The model suggests that financial innovation may have caused the ongoing decline in U. S. savings rates, since financial innovation increases liquidity, eliminating commitment opportunities. Finally, the model implies that financial market innovation may reduce welfare by providing ''too much'' liquidity.

AB Eight alternative methods of eliciting preferences between money and a consumption good are identified: two of these are standard willingness-to-accept and willingness-to-pay measures. These methods differ with respect to the reference point used and the dimension in which responses are expressed. The loss aversion hypothesis of Tversky and Kahneman's theory of reference-dependent preferences predicts systematic differences between the preferences elicited by these methods. These predictions are tested by eliciting individuals' preferences for two private consumption goods; the experimental design is incentive-compatible and controls for income and substitution effects. The theory's predictions are broadly confirmed.

AB In some experiments rational players who understand the structure of the game could improve their payoff. We bound the size of the observed losses in several such experiments. To do this, we suppose that observed play resembles an equilibrium because players learn about their opponents' play. Consequently, in an extensive-form game, some actions that are not optimal given the true distribution of opponents' play could be optimal given available information. We find that average losses are small: $0.03 to $0.64 per player with stakes between $2 and $30. In one of the three experiments we examine, this also implies a narrow range of outcome.

These measures are based on survey responses to hypothetical situations constructed using an economic theorist's concept of the underlying parameters. The individual measures of preference parameters display heterogeneity. Estimated risk tolerance and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution are essentially uncorrelated across individuals. Measured risk tolerance is positively related to risky behaviors, including smoking, drinking, failing to have insurance, and holding stocks rather than Treasury bills. These relationships are both statistically and quantitatively significant, although measured risk tolerance explains only a small fraction of the variation of the studied behaviors.

AB The paper examines the evolutionary foundations of bilateral bargaining behavior. Interaction is assumed to be personal, in the sense that agents may recognize each others' bargaining strategies. In particular, the model allows interaction between ''obstinate'' agents, whose demands are independent of the opponent, and ''sophisticated' agents, who adapt to their opponent's expected play. When the pie's size is certain, evolution favors obstinate agents who insist on getting at least half the pie. The unique outcome is an equal split. In sufficiently noisy environments, sophisticated behavior appears in equilibrium together with greedy obstinate behavior. There is then a positive probability of conflict.

We provide a simple explanation for these complex phenomena by showing how externally observable rules that define a market cause high allocative efficiency when individuals remain within the confines of these rules. We also show how the oft-ignored shape of extramarginal demand and supply affects efficiency by influencing the inverse relationship between the magnitude of efficiency loss and its probability.

Results from this study show that the more frequently returns are evaluated, the more risk averse investors will be. The results are in line with the behavioral hypothesis of ''myopic loss aversion,'' which assumes that people are myopic in evaluating outcomes over time, and are more sensitive to losses than to gains. The results have relevance for the equity premium puzzle, and also for the marketing strategies of fund managers.

Two implications of myopic loss aversion are tested experimentally. 1.

If all payoffs are increased enough to eliminate losses, investors will accept more risk. In a task in which investors learn from experience, both predictions are supported. The investors who got the most frequent feedback (and thus the most information) took the least risk and earned the least money.

AB We construct a model of a dynamic economy in which lenders cannot force borrowers to repay their debts unless the debts are secured. In such an economy, durable assets play a dual role: not only are they factors of production, but they also serve as collateral for loans. The dynamic interaction between credit limits and asset prices turns out to be a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist, amplify, and spill over to other sectors. We show that small, temporary shocks to technology or income distribution can generate large, persistent fluctuations in output and asset prices.

TI Returns to scale in US production: Estimates and implications
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID MARGINAL COST; INDUSTRY; PRICE
AB A typical (roughly) two-digit industry in the United States appears to have constant or slightly decreasing returns to scale. Three puzzles emerge, however. First, estimates often rise at higher levels of aggregation. Second, apparent decreasing returns contradicts evidence of only small economic profits. Third, estimates with value added differ substantially from those with gross output. A representative-firm paradigm cannot explain these puzzles, but a simple story of aggregation over heterogeneous units can. Theory and evidence on aggregation invalidate the common use of demand-side instruments. Finally, we discuss implications of heterogeneity for macroeconomic modeling: A one-sector macroeconomic model that ignores heterogeneity may sometimes require firm-level parameters, but at other times the model may require the ''biased'' aggregate parameters.

   matching in the market for clinical psychologists
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL EXPERIMENT; ORGANIZATION; PHYSICIANS; RESIDENTS; MARRIAGE; GAME
AB In the context of entry-level labor markets, we consider the potential transactions that have to be evaluated before equilibrium transactions can he identified. These potential transactions involve offers that are rejected. After an initial phase in which many offers can be proffered in parallel, subsequent potential transactions must be processed serially, since a new offer cannot be made until an outstanding offer is rejected. In this phase even a small time required to process offers and rejections may cause bottlenecks. In many, perhaps most, decentralized labor markets, this means that transactions have to be finalized before there is time for the market to clear, that is, before all the potential transactions that would need to be evaluated in order to reach a stable outcome can in fact be evaluated. This has implications for the strategic behavior of firms and workers. In particular, in deciding to whom to offer a position, a firm may have strong incentives to consider not only its preferences over workers but also the likelihood that its offer will be accepted, since if its offer is rejected it may find that many other potential employees have become unavailable in the interim. The analysis is carried out in connection with the decentralized market for clinical psychologists. The implications for other kinds of markets are considered.

Traditional thought suggests that this prohibition makes it harder for firms to collude, and economists have concluded that the Sherman Act operates in the public interest. I provide an alternative explanation for the act that also accounts for the small sanctions chosen by the legislature. When firms interact in a dynamic environment in which the law helps them to prevent renegotiation, the firms may benefit from the law that makes it costly, but not very costly, to meet to discuss prices. The Sherman Act may help firms to collude.

AB This paper addresses two long-standing positive questions in public finance: (i) Why is the property tax, despite widespread popular complaints against its fairness, the almost exclusive tax instrument used by local governments, and (ii) why do we consistently observe higher levels of governments (states) undermining local property tax systems through income tax-funded grants and state-imposed caps on local property tax rates? A new intuitive argument to explain question is presented and tested in simulations using a computable general equilibrium model with parameters set to be consistent with New Jersey data. Both the intuitive argument and the simulation results indicate that setting local income tax rates to zero is a dominant strategy for community planners. When faced with popular sentiment against the property tax, community planners can collude and introduce local income taxes simultaneously to prevent adverse general equilibrium migration and price changes. Since zero income tax rates are dominant strategies,however, such an agreement is enforceable only if an outsider such as the state government steps in. The institution of state grants funded through a state income tax can play such an enforcement role.

AB This paper considers the design of an optimal unemployment insurance system. The problem is modeled as a repeated principal-agent problem involving a risk-averse agent-the unemployed worker-and a risk-neutral principal, which cannot monitor the agent's search effort. The optimal long-term contract subject to the associated incentive constraints is characterized, This contract involves a replacement ratio that decreases throughout the unemployment spell and a wage tax after reemployment that, under some mild regularity conditions, increases with the length of the unemployment spell. Some numerical results are presented that suggest that the gains from switching to this optimal unemployment insurance scheme could be quite large. The performance of this optimal contract is also compared to alternative liquidity provision mechanisms.

ID INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; MARKETS
AB This paper develops a model of growth and income inequalities in the presence of imperfect capital markets, and it analyses the trickle-down effect of capital accumulation. Moral hazard with limited wealth constraints on the part of the borrowers is the source of both capital market imperfections and the emergence of persistent income inequalities. Three main conclusions are obtained from this model.
   First, when the rate of capital accumulation is sufficiently high, the economy converges to a unique invariant wealth distribution. Second, even though the trickle-down mechanism can lead to a unique steady-state distribution under laissez-faire, there is room for government intervention: in particular, redistribution of wealth from rich lenders to poor and middle-class borrowers improves the production efficiency of the economy both because it brings about greater equality of opportunity and also because it accelerates the trickle-down process. Third, the process of capital accumulation initially has the effect of widening inequalities but in later stages it reduces them: in other words, this model can generate a Kuznets curve.

ID INCOME; GROWTH
AB With decreasing returns and first-best credit, the long-run interest rate and aggregate output are uniquely determined, and wealth dispersion among individuals or firms is irrelevant. Introducing credit rationing into the Solow model modifies these conclusions. Multiple stationary interest rates and wealth distributions can exist because higher initial rates can be self-reinforcing through higher credit rationing and lower capital accumulation. The wealth accumulation process is ergodic in every steady state, but wealth mobility is lower with higher steady-state interest rates. Aggregate output is higher in steady states with lower interest rates because credit is better allocated. Short-run interest rate or distribution shocks can be self-sustaining and can have long-run effects on output through the induced dynamics of the wealth distribution and credit rationing.

AB The paper shows that an increase in competition has two effects on managerial incentives: It increases the probability of liquidation, which has a positive effect on managerial effort, but it also reduces the firm's profits, which may make it less attractive to induce high effort. Thus, the total effect is ambiguous.
   I identify natural circumstances where increasing competition unambiguously reduces managerial slack. In general, however, this relation need not be monotonic. A simple example demonstrates that-starting from a monopoly-managerial effort may increase as additional competitors enter the market, but will eventually decrease when competition becomes too intense.

We analyse two different games in which both direct trade and indirect trade are available. We show that in general equilibrium outcomes are inefficient, so that Diamond's efficiency result is fragile. Intermediation may increase rather than decrease transaction costs. Disintermediation may also be an equilibrium. We discuss the role played by the nonconvexities of banks' technology and that played by competition for deposits and loans.

In the first model contracts are exchanged on a competitive market in which traders expectations concerning conditions that prevail within specific markets adjust until markets ''clear''. In the second model contract designers compete directly against one another by offering alternate contracts. It is shown that Walrasian allocations correspond with the equilibrium allocations in the model with direct competition when the number of traders is made large. Furthermore, the expectational assumptions that drive the Walrasian analysis coincide with off the equilibrium path conjectures in the problem with direct competition.

Such firm-specific learning-by-doing has two important consequences: (1) it can in some circumstances dramatically reduce the long-run average level of innovation; (2) it leads to endogeneous bunching, or waves, in innovative activity.

A search-theoretic general equilibrium approach is adopted to study a two-country, two-currency model. For some parameter values of the model, there exist some pure-strategy equilibria in which commodity-currency trade is conducted primarily through local currency and in which there is active currency-currency exchange. The coexistence of valued foreign currency and its local non-acceptability conforms largely with the country-specific cash-in-advance constraint that is often assumed exogenously in international finance literature.

This paper evaluates quantitatively the economic effects of the different policies used to finance these two wars. Counterfactual experiments are used to explore the implications of financing World War II like the Korean War, and financing the Korean War like World War II. I find that using a Korean War policy during World War II would have resulted in much lower output and welfare relative to the actual policy.

ID INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH
AB Widely used ''purchasing power parity'' comparisons of per capita GDP are not true quantity indexes and are subject to systematic substitution bins. This bias may distort measurement of convergence and divergence. Extending Varian's nonparametric construction of a true index gives the set of true indexes, including the new Ideal Afriat Index. These indexes are utility-consistent and independent of arbitrary reference price vectors. We establish bounds on the dispersion of true multilateral indexes, hence bounds on convergence. International price indexes understate both true GDP dispersion and, where prices are converging over time, the rate of true quantity convergence.

AB This paper replicates standard consumption function tests of Ricardian equivalence using series generated from a model which nests Ricardian equivalence within a non-Ricardian alternative (due to finite horizons and/or distortionary taxation). I show that the estimates of the effects of taxation on consumption are not robust and that standard tests may have weaknesses which can lend to conflicting results, whether Ricardian equivalence holds or not, The simulations also show that no clear conclusions about Ricardian equivalence can be drawn from observing a low correlation between the current account and government budget deficits.

The paper deals with simultaneous-equations bias by developing a proxy for the errors the Federal Reserve makes in forecasting the extent to which Treasury operations Will add or drain reserves available to private banks. These errors induce fluctuations in bank reserves which have measurable consequences for the federal funds rate. The paper estimates that a reduction in nonborrowed reserves of $30 million, if sustained for an entire 14-day reserve maintenance period, will cause the federal finds rare to rise by 10 basis points.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

ID MONETARY-POLICY; INDEPENDENCE; COMMITMENT
AB Inflation-targeting regimes (like those of New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden) are interpreted as having explicit inflation targets and implicit employment targets. Without employment persistence, an ''inflation-target-conservative'' central bank eliminates the inflation bias, mimics an optimal inflation contract, and dominates a Rogoff ''weight-conservative'' central bank. With employment persistence, a state-contingent inflation bias and a stabilization bins also arise. A constant inflation target and a constant inflation contract are still equivalent. A state-contingent inflation target combined with a weight-conservative central bank can achieve the equilibrium corresponding to an optimal rule under commitment.

We use establishments' hours-week to construct measures of the deviation between desired and actual employment and use these as the establishments' main state variables. Our main findings are: (i) microeconomic adjustment functions are nonlinear, with plants adjusting disproportionately to large shortages; (ii) adjustments are often either large or nil, suggesting the presence of nonconvexities in the adjustment cost technologies: (iii) the bulk of average employment fluctuations is accounted for by aggregate, rather than reallocation, shocks; and (iv) microeconomic nonlinearities amplify the impact of large aggregate shocks.

AB We present a model in which a government's current capital-control policy signals future policies. Controls on capital outflows evolve in response to news on technology, conditional on government attitudes toward taxation of capital. When there is uncertainty over government types, a policy of liberal capital outflows sends a favorable signal that may trigger a capital inflow. This prediction is consistent with the experience of several countries that have liberalized their capital accounts.

AB If investors are rational, the variance of closed-end mutual fund returns should equal the variance of the underlying securities in their portfolios. In fact, this paper shows that the average closed-end fund's monthly return is 64 percent more volatile than its assets. Unlike variance-bounds tests, this facilitates an excess volatility test that does not rely on strong assumptions about discount rates or dividend streams. Although largely idiosyncratic, 15 percent of the average fund's excess risk is explained by market risk, small-firm risk, and risk that affects other closed-end funds.

ID MARKETS
AB Despite the growing integration of international financial markets, investors do not diversify internationally to any significant extent. We show that this ''international diversification puzzle'' is deepened once we consider the implications of nontraded human capital for portfolio composition. While growth rates of labor and capital income are not highly correlated within countries, we find that the returns to human capital and physical capital are very highly correlated within four OECD countries. Hedging human capital risk therefore involves a substantial short position in domestic marketable assets. A diversified world portfolio will involve a negative position in domestic marketable assets.

It documents that this advice is inconsistent with the mutual-fund separation theorem, which states that all investors should hold the same composition of risky assets. In contrast to the theorem, popular advisors recommend that aggressive investors hold a lower ratio of bonds to stocks than conservative investors. The paper explores various possible explanations of this puzzle and finds them unsatisfactory.

ID COMPETITIVE-EQUILIBRIUM; CORE EQUIVALENCE; ECONOMIES; PREFERENCES;
   THEOREM; CONVERGENCE; SETS
AB Equivalence of the core and the set of Walrasian allocations has long been taken as one of the basic tests of perfect competition. The present paper examines this basic test of perfect competition in economies with an infinite dimensional space of commodities and a large finite number of agents. In this context, we cannot expect equality of the core and the set of Walrasian allocations; rather, as in the finite dimensional context, we look for theorems establishing core convergence (that is, approximate decentralization of core allocations in economies with a large finite number of agents).
   Previous work in this area has established that core convergence for replica economies and core equivalence for economies with a continuum of agents continue to be valid in the infinite dimensional context under assumptions much the same as those needed in the finite dimensional context. For general large finite economies, however, we present here a sequence of examples of failure of core convergence. These examples point to a serious disconnection between replica economies and continuum economies on the one hand, and general large finite economies on the other hand. We identify the source of this disconnection as the measurability requirements that are implicit in the continuum model, and which correspond to compactness requirements that have especially serious economic content in the infinite dimensional context.
   We also obtain a positive result. When the commodity space is L(1), the space of integrable functions on a finite measure space, we establish core convergence under the assumptions that marginal utility goes to zero as consumption tends to infinity and the per capita social endowment lies above a consumption bundle which is equidesirable with respect to the preferences. This positive result depends on a version of the Shapley-Folkman theorem for L(1).

AB Consider a two-player discounted repeated game in which each player optimizes with respect to a prior belief about his opponent's repeated game strategy. One would like to argue that if beliefs are cautious, then each player's best response will be in the support, loosely speaking, of his opponent's belief and that, therefore, players will learn as the game unfolds to predict the continuation path of play. If this conjecture were true, a convergence result due to Kalai and Lehrer would imply that the continuation path of the repeated game would asymptotically resemble that of a Nash equilibrium. One would thus have constructed a theory in which Nash equilibrium behavior is a necessary long-run consequence of optimization by cautious players. This paper points out an obstacle to such a theory. Loosely put, in many repeated games, if players optimize with respect to beliefs that satisfy a diversity condition termed neutrality, then each player will choose a strategy that his opponent was certain would not be played.

AB This paper reports a laboratory experiment designed to examine the price formation process in a simple market institution, the single call market. The experiment features random values and costs each period, so each period generates a new price formation observation. Other design features are intended to enhance the predictive power of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) theory developed recently for this trading institution. We find that the data support several qualitative implications of the BNE, but that subjects' bid and ask behavior is not as responsive to changes in the pricing rule as the BNE predictions. Bids and asks tend to reveal more of the underlying values and costs than predicted, particularly when subjects are experienced. Nevertheless, observed trading efficiency falls below the BNE prediction. The results offer more support for the BNE when subjects compete against Nash ''robot'' opponents. A simple learning model accounts for several of the deviations from BNE.

This is accomplished by not including consequences among the formal primitives. Instead, the effect of consequences is modeled indirectly, through conditional preferences over acts. The main results concern the aggregation of conditional utilities to form an unconditional utility, including the case of additive aggregation. Applications, obtained by further specifying the structure of acts and conditional preferences, include disappointment, regret, and the subjective value of information.

AB The existence of part-whole bias has been hotly disputed in the recent contingent valuation literature. This paper reports on an experiment into part-whole bias, Employing vouchers for parts of a restaurant meal and using an incentive compatible procedure, valuations of the parts and of the whole were elicited. The sum of the valuations of the parts consistently exceeded that of the whole, providing evidence of the existence of part-whole bias in a context where traditional explanations would not have predicted it.

AB This paper assesses the performance of immigrants in the UK labour market. After reviewing the changes in the source countries of immigration using data from the GHS over the period 1973-92, we document the significantly higher level of schooling attained by immigrants relative to natives. This education gap has risen over successive cohorts primarily because of changes in the national origin of immigrants. Our analysis of relative wages shows that the main group of disadvantaged immigrants are blacks who have significant foreign work experience. However, there are strong assimilation effects for this group so that this disadvantage is reduced significantly as duration in the United Kingdom increases.

AB This paper examines whether demographic variables and other household characteristics are more likely to affect the intercept of the Euler equation or the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (ISE) of the household. Analysis of British data suggests that demographics affect the growth rate of consumption in a purely transitory way, while the educational level and the employment status of the wife appear to have a significant effect on the ISE. The effect of the employment status of the head is more uncertain. After taking these differences into account, the hypothesis of no excess sensitivity cannot be rejected for households with two earners.

AB This paper investigates whether excess stock price volatility may be due in part to a failure of the market to form rational expectations. Using data on analysts' expectations of long run earnings growth for individual companies, we report a number of interrelated results which lend support to this hypothesis. These results together imply that the cross-section of stock prices will also be excessively dispersed, so that stocks with low earnings expectations are underpriced and stocks with high earnings expectations are overpriced. As analysts' forecasts errors become apparent, stock prices adjust accordingly and so excess returns accrue.

We show that the concept nests many approaches to the analysis of individual and family behaviour. We find conditions for demand with universal decentralisation to he the result of an individual utility maximisation process and also for such demands to he the result of a household welfare maximisation procedure. We explore the link between universal decentralisation and quasi separability. There are connections between universal decentralisation and a nonlinear idea of the rank of a demand system.

In the hedonic price function we include not only the 'objective' characteristics appearing on the label of the bottle, but also the sensory characteristics of the wine. Our data come from an experimental study in which juries have evaluated and graded a sample of Bordeaux wines. The estimation of the hedonic price equation shows that the market price is essentially determined by the objective characteristics, The estimation of a jury grade equation shows that quality, unlike the market price, is essentially determined by the sensory characteristics.

The labour markets of both the EMU countries are unionised, and there is involuntary unemployment in equilibrium. We explore the intra and intercountry effects of changes in bargaining power. We then examine optimal government expenditures in each EMU country; we find that there is a positive spillover, and that expenditures are strategic complements. The coordinated equilibrium involves higher expenditure than the uncoordinated equilibrium.

Even in there circumstances, the social benefits of countervailing power may not be realised as the supplier may seek to protect its profits by using a refusal to supply restraint to engage in exclusive trading.

In this paper we develop an open-economy model of output maximisation, where investment and capital flows are crucial determinants of output and are in turn influenced by interest rare policy and credible control of inflation. The model represents an extension to short-run models of government policy-making, and emphasises that coordination of relative interest rates is as important as control of inflation.

AB Using a variant of the Cagan model with rational expectations, this paper shows that expected stabilisation can result in a budget deficit in excess of the maximum inflation tax. A cap on the deficit dampens inflation expectations and raises real balances thus increasing the yield of the inflation tax for any given rate of inflation. This study extends the work of Drazen and Helpman (1990) by including a stochastic budgetary process and using option pricing theory. It uses parameter values of the semi-elasticity of demand for money to provide estimates of the maximum viable real deficit.

Inequality measures are related to the parameters of this distribution, whose economic determinants are explained. It is found that the principal cause of rising self-employment income inequality over this period was a substantial increase in the heterogeneity of the self-employed themselves. In contrast, the increased numbers engaged in self-employment over the period seems to have had no discernible effect on inequality via the parameters of the self-employment income distribution.

AB The paper examines the process by which owner-occupied housing market transactions take place. The objective is to develop a model which can reproduce the slow build-up of housing chains of connected owner-occupier sales and purchases. The approach here applies stringent discontinuous preferences over house type and location to develop a computer model which will produce these housing chains. The process derived demonstrates that existing owner-occupiers spend longer in housing market search than will first-time buyers or the sellers of new dwellings. The implication that existing owner-occupiers 'lag' in the housing market is tested on UK housing price data, with results that clearly support this general hypothesis.

This paper examines alternative semi-parametric quasi-likelihood approaches. Essentially, these methods embed sample versions of the moment conditions used in GMM in a non-parametric quasi-likelihood function by use of additional parameters associated with these moment conditions. Specification and misspecification rests may be defined which are similar in nature to the classical tests and are first-order equivalent to the corresponding GMM statistics. The structure of the semi-parametric quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is explored for models estimated by instrumental variables.

Over a third of male manual workers would prefer to work fewer hours at the prevailing wage than they do and we estimate that on average desired hours per week are 4.3 lower than actual hours. We hypothesise that job insecurity and scarcity of alternative job opportunities enable employers to set hours constraints above employee preferences and find that the minimum hours constraints set by firms are an increasing function of the unemployment rate an individual faces.

ID INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP
AB This paper develops a theory of the allocation of formal authority (the right to decide) and real authority (the effective control over decisions) within organizations, and it illustrates how a formally integrated structure can accommodate various degrees of ''real'' integration. Real authority is determined by the structure of information, which in turn depends on the allocation of formal authority. An increase in an agent's real authority promotes initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. After spelling out (some of) the main determinants of the delegation of formal authority within organizations, the paper examines a number of factors that increase the subordinates' real authority in a formally integrated structure: overload, lenient rules, urgency of decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of superiors. Finally, the amount of communication in an organization is shown to depend on the allocation of formal authority.

ID CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS; POLICY; CASEWORK; CHOICE
AB While it is widely believed by academics, politicians, and the popular press that incumbent members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district, the empirical evidence supporting that claim is extremely weak. One explanation for the failure to uncover the expected relationship between federal spending and election outcomes is that incumbents who expect to have difficulty being reelected are likely to exert greater effort in obtaining federal outlays. Since it is generally impossible to adequately measure this effort, the estimated impact of spending is biased do cvn ward because of an omitted variable bias. We address this estimation problem using instrumental variables. For each House district, we use spending outside the district but inside the state containing the district as an instrument for spending in the district Federal spending is affected by a large number Of actors (e.g., governors, senators, mayors, and other House members in the state delegation), leading to positive correlations in federal spending across the House districts within states. However, federal spending outside of a district is unlikely to be strongly correlated dth the strength of that district's electoral challenge. In contrast to previous studies, we find strong evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional $100 per capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote. The only category of federal spending that does not appear to yield electoral rewards is direct transfers to individuals.

AB This paper examines the claim that expansion of the voting franchise has been an important factor in the growth of government. State government spending and state and local spending are explained using a panel of 46 states for 1950-88. Elimination of poll taxes and literacy tests led to higher turnout, particularly among the poor, and a poorer pivotal voter. As predicted, we find that these changes, a fall in the income of voters relative to state income, and the ouster of Republicans from state government led to a sharp rise in welfare spending but no change in other spending.

AB Regulation regimes subject to the influence of interest groups are compared. It is shown that the allocation of the regulated commodity varies with the implemented control and that the advantage of prices (vs. quotas) increases with the elasticity of the demand for or the supply of the commodity and decreases with the number of organized producers in the regulated industry. Control regimes can be ranked for negative, but not positive, externalities, Finally, a control regime leading to a more efficient commodity allocation also entails using fewer resources in rent-seeking activities.

I show that the model fits well data on the duration of negotiations and government durations in postwar Italy. Also, I show that changes in the proposer selection process would not affect either the duration of negotiations or government durations, whereas the imposition of a strict deadline would in general reduce the incentives to delay agreement as well as government durations.

AB We test whether the time-series positive correlation of inflation and intermarket relative price variability is also present in a cross section of U.S. cities. We find this correlation to be a robust empirical regularity: cities that have higher than average inflation also have higher than average relative price dispersion, ceteris paribus. This result holds for different periods of time, for different classes of goods, and across different time horizons. Our results suggest that at least part of the relationship between inflation and relative price variability cannot be explained by monetary factors.

ID TRADITION
AB The relationship between Milton Friedman's monetary economics and the views espoused by Chicago and non-Chicago quantity theorists during the years 1930-36 is examined. Contrary to recent interpretations, Chicago economists advanced the efficacy of monetary policy as the means of escaping from the Great Depression, provided that such a policy was implemented by the use of budget deficits to generate monetary expansion. The use of the quantity theory of money to provide a theoretical rationale for budget deficits distinguished the Chicago economists from other quantity theorists and left them less susceptible to the Keynesian revolution. The claim that Harvard was an important center for monetary research in the early 1930s is refuted.

AB This paper argues that the typical household's saving is better described by a ''buffer-stock'' version than by the traditional version of the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis (LC/PIH) model. Buffer-stock behavior emerges if consumers with important income uncertainty are sufficiently impatient. In the traditional model, consumption growth is determined solely by tastes. In contrast, buffer-stock consumers set average consumption growth equal to average labor income growth, regardless of tastes. The model can explain three empirical puzzles: the ''consumption/income parallel'' documented by Carroll and Summers; the ''consumption/income divergence'' first documented in the 1930s; and the stability of the household age/wealth profile over time despite the unpredictability of idiosyncratic wealth changes.

AB Two of the most interesting facts of the postwar international growth experience are (1) the conditional convergence finding that, after controlling for measures of education and government policies, poor countries tend to grow faster than rich ones; and (2) a small group of export-oriented economies in East Asia have been able to grow at rates that are so high that they defy historical comparisons. This paper shows that it is possible to explain these facts by combining a weak form of the factor-price-equalization theorem of international trade with the Ramsey model of economic growth.

The approach has a number of attractive features. First, it is a conceptualization of a pure form of representative democracy in which government is by, as well as of; the people. Second, the model is analytically tractable, being able to handle multidimensional issue and policy spaces very naturally. Third, it provides a vehicle for answering normative questions about the performance of representative democracy.

AB Some commentators argue that increased sorting into internally homogeneous neighborhoods, schools, and marriages is radically polarizing society. Calibration of a formal model, however, suggests that the steady-state standard deviation of education would increase only 1.7 percent if the correlation between neighbors' education doubled, and would fall only 1.6 percent if educational sorting by neighborhood disappeared. The steady-state standard deviation of education would grow 1 percent if the correlation between spouses' education increased from 0.6 to 0.8. In fact, marital and neighborhood sorting have been stable, or even decreasing historically. Sorting has somewhat more significant effects on intergenerational mobility than on inequality.

AB No. This paper investigates the relationship between financing constraints and investment-cash flow sensitivities by analyzing the firms identified by Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen as having unusually high investment-cash flow sensitivities. We find that firms that appear less financially constrained exhibit significantly greater sensitivities than firms that appear more financially constrained. We find this pattern for the entire sample period, subperiods, and individual years. These results (and simple theoretical arguments) suggest that higher sensitivities cannot be interpreted as evidence that firms are more financially constrained. These findings call into question the interpretation of most previous research that uses this methodology.

AB This paper examines how personal bankruptcy and bankruptcy exemptions affect the supply and demand for credit. While generous state-level bankruptcy exemptions are probably viewed by most policy-makers as benefiting less-well-off borrowers, our results using data from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that they increase the amount of credit held by high-asset households and reduce the availability and amount of credit to low-asset households, conditioning on observable characteristics. Thus, bankruptcy exemptions redistribute credit toward borrowers with high assets. Interest rates on automobile loans for low-asset households also appear to be higher in high exemption states.

Our cross-sectional results show that plants that use a large number of new technologies employ more educated workers, employ relatively more managers, professionals, and precision-craft workers, and pay higher wages. However, our longitudinal analysis shows little correlation between skill upgrading and the adoption of new technologies. It appears that plants that adopt new factory automation technologies have more skilled workforces both pre- and postadoption.

We examine this issue with three large cross-sectional surveys from Germany. First, we confirm that the estimated wage differential associated with computer use in Germany is very similar to the U. S. differential. Second, we also measure large differentials for on-the-job use of calculators, telephones, pens or pencils, or for those who work while sitting down. We argue that these findings cast some doubt on the literal interpretation of the computer use wage differential as reflecting true returns to computer use or skill.

ID RETAIL; ASSET
AB We test and confirm that retail gasoline prices respond more quickly to increases than to decreases in crude oil prices. Among the possible sources of this asymmetry are production/inventory adjustment lags and market power of some sellers. By analyzing price transmission at different points in the distribution chain, we attempt to shed light on these theories. Spot prices for generic gasoline show asymmetry in responding to crude oil price changes, which may reflect inventory adjustment effects. Asymmetry also appears in the response of retail prices to wholesale price changes, possibly indicating short-run market power among retailers.

AB There are several solutions to the Nash bargaining problem in the literature. Since various authors have expressed preferences for one solution over another, we find it useful to study preferences over solutions in their own right. We identify a set of appealing axioms on such preferences that lead to unanimity in the choice of solution, which turns out to be the solution of Nash.

ID AGGREGATE UNCERTAINTY; INFLATION; PRICES
AB This paper extends the Kiyotaki-Wright search model of hat money to allow for divisible money and goods. The extension allows me to examine the standard issues in monetary economics, such as the neutrality and superneutrality of money, by severing the artificial link in the Kiyotaki-Wright model between the money supply and the number of money holders. It is shown that money is neutral, but not superneutral. Money growth generates a trading opportunity effect: it changes the fraction of different agents in the economy and hence changes the probability with which agents have a successful match. In addition, money growth has a negative effect on the real money balance that is familiar in Walrasian monetary models. The balance of the two effects can imply a positive optimal money growth rate.

The definition given is broad enough to encompass a number of potential applications in econometrics including inferring the rank of demand, testing whether for a given set of instruments it is possible to identify a linear model, and testing arbitrage pricing theory. The paper gives methods for testing hypotheses concerning the number of factors, using series and kernel based nonparametric methods and also considers the problem of estimating the number of factors. The methods are compared in a small simulation study and an application to determining the rank of demand systems is considered.

AB This paper uses micro data to estimate the determinants of household income and to measure how human capital and earnings uncertainty affect consumption. We also estimate how home-owners react to capital gains on housing and assess whether these gains are treated in the same way as other sources of income. Using UK micro data we show that estimates of permanent income and of earnings uncertainty have powerful effects on spending. We find that precautionary motives may account for a substantial proportion of household saving. We also provide estimates of the shape of the earnings profile for various occupational groups and of the returns to education in different professions.

AB We examine the effects of introducing actuarially fair annuity markers into an overlapping generations model of endogenous growth. The complete annuitisation of agents' wealth is not, in general, dynamically optimal; the degree of annuitisation that is dynamically optimal depends nonmonotonically on the expected length of retirement and on the pay-as-you-go social security tax rate. The government has an incentive to restrict the availability of actuarially fair annuities contracts, and can often move the economy from a pay-as-you-go to a fully-funded social security system via voluntary contributions to a government sponsored, actuarially fair pension today accompanied by reductions in social security taxes tomorrow.

AB We use longitudinal data on children and their parents to assess the extent of intergenerational mobility in Britain. Based on data from the National Child Development Survey, a cohort of all individuals born in a week of March 1958, we find that the extent of intergenerational mobility is limited. We report a clear intergenerational correlation between fathers and both sons and daughters in terms of labour market earnings and years of schooling. We also reveal an important asymmetry in intergenerational earnings mobility, with upward mobility from the bottom of the earnings distribution being more likely than downward mobility from the top.

AB Little is known about the effect of unemployment insurance (UI) on employment durations. In this paper we rake advantage of a unique accidental experiment in the Canadian UI system which created an exogenous increase in the entrance requirement (the number of weeks an individual must work to qualify for benefits) of up to 4 weeks in some regions. We identify the effects of this increase primarily by comparing the hazard rate out of employment for the experimental year, 1990, with that for the preceding year in regions where other parameters of the UI system do not change.

AB How are pay and promotion prospects related to job responsibility? A job entails responsibility to the extent that the value of the job outcome is sensitive to the worker's input of effort. In my model, an employer uses termination contracts to elicit effort from workers. The optimal wage increases with responsibility. I show that the employer can reduce incentive costs by structuring a job ladder and offering workers a self-enforcing prospect of promotion. In fact, the employers will choose to pay differentiated wages to identical workers in identical jobs, promoting, workers from the lower-paying to the higher-paying positions as vacancies occur.

AB Squeezes are registered in the forward market for Brent crude oil. The squeezer accumulates forward contracts and creates artificial demand. This causes the price to surge and introduces uncertainty about the market outcome. Squeezes therefore render the market institution less palatable to other market participants. Producers may have a long term interest in keeping market clearing smooth, e.g. by supplying stocks to squeezed traders. The extent to which such self-regulation should be carried out is analysed in the context of a repealed game. Unless the probability of a squeeze is very small, self-regulation should be possible.

AB Trade theories based on increasing returns have two predictions for regional economies: employment concentrates in industry centres, and regional nominal wages are decreasing in transport costs to industry centres. I test these hypotheses using data on regional manufacturing in Mexico before and after trade liberalisation. Employment and wage patterns are consistent with the idea that market access matters for industry location. Under the closed economy, industry concentrated in Mexico City. Since trade reform, industry has relocated to the United States-Mexico border. Estimation results show that regional manufacturing wages are decreasing in distance from Mexico City and from the border.

AB We examine the extent to which developing countries that do little, if any, research and development themselves benefit from R & D that is performed in the industrial countries. By trading with an industrial country that has a large 'stock of knowledge' from its cumulative R & D activities, a developing country can boost its productivity by importing a larger variety of intermediate products and capital equipment embodying foreign knowledge, and by acquiring useful information that would otherwise be costly to obtain. Our results, based on data for 77 developing countries, suggest that R & D spillovers from 22 industrial countries over 1971-90 are substantial.

We demonstrate that both demand and supply side factors can explain this favourite-longshot bias and propose new empirical rests to identify the influence of insider trading on the bias. The results suggest that the adverse selection problem faced by bookmakers, in the context of betters who may possess superior information, is capable of explaining at least some of the observed bias.

ID COMMON KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR
AB We say that a player is certain of an event A if she assigns probability 1 to A. There is common certainty (CC) of A if the event A occurred, each player is certain of A, each player is certain that every other player is certain of A. and so forth. It is shown that in a generic perfect-information game the set of outcomes that are consistent with common certainty of rationality (CCR) at the beginning of the game coincides with the set of outcomes that survive one deletion of weakly dominated strategies and then iterative deletion of strongly dominated strategies. Thus. the backward induction outcome is not the only outcome that is consistent with CCR. In particular. cooperation in Rosenthal's (1981) centipede game. and fighting in Selten's (1978) chainstore game are consistent with CCR at the beginning of the game.
   Next. it is shown that. if in addition to CCR. there is CC that each player assigns a positive probability to the true strategies and beliefs of the other players, and if there is CC of the support of the beliefs of each player, then the outcome of the game is a Nash equilibrium outcome.

AB The production of data. and the functioning of the market for observations. are universal concerns to all fields of positive economics. Economists. however. have typically placed greater emphasis on systematically analyzing the consumption of data than on considering its production. In the production of data through surveys. an important input market is that of labour. in which a demander trades observations with the supplying sample members. This paper analyses optimal monopsony compensation in such data markets, the important relationship it bears to estimation using the data that are obtained, and the statistical effects of implicit public wage regulations that are present in U.S. markets for observations.

AB This paper shows that in a general equilibrium model with an infinite horizon in which production may exhibit increasing returns to scale or non-convexities, marginal cost pricing equilibria exist and are essential. that is, stable with respect to small perturbations of the economy. As in many important models of market imperfections, marginal cost pricing equilibria need not be Pareto optimal in the presence of non-convexities, so the systematic approaches to equilibrium analysis in infinite-dimensional commodity spaces. which rely crucially on the First Welfare Theorem, cannot be used. Instead. this paper introduces Leray-Schauder degree theory. the extension of degree theory to Banach and locally convex spaces, as the natural methodology for showing that equilibria exist and for analyzing qualitative features of equilibria such as local uniqueness or essentiality.

AB In this paper a competitive distribution of auctions is described for an economy consisting of an infinite number of buyers and sellers, all of whom differ according to their valuation for the single indivisible object being traded. A competitive distribution of auctions is such that no seller can improve his profits by deviating to any alternative direct mechanism. It is shown that the competitive distribution of auctions will have the property that each buyer and seller's best reply is independent of his beliefs about the tastes of other buyers and sellers on the market.

AB The subjective probabilities implied by Savage's (1954, 1972) Postulates are finitely but not countably additive. The failure of countable additivity leads to two known classes of dominance paradoxes. money pumps and indifference between an act and one that pointwise dominates it. There is a common resolution to these classes of paradoxes and to any others that might arise from failures of countably additivity. It consists of reinterpreting finitely additive probabilities as the ''traces'' of countably additive probabilities on larger state spaces. The new and larger state spaces preserve the essential decision-theoretic structures of the original spaces.

AB The evidence on international capital immobility is extensive, including the lack of international portfolio diversification real interest differentials across countries, and the high correlation between domestic savings and investment. We develop a model with asymmetric information between countries that helps rationalize all the above observations and then examine the implications of this model for optimal domestic tax policy. Without asymmetric information past work showed that small open economies should not impose corporate income taxes. With asymmetric information, the optimal policy instead involves government subsidies to capital imports. Some omitted factors that argue against subsidizing capital imports are explored briefly.

The ability to apply foreign tax credits against home-country tax liabilities reduces an investor's incentive to avoid high-tax foreign locations. State corporate tau rate differences of 1 percent are associated with differences of 9-11 percent between the investment shares of foreign-tax-credit investors and the investment shares of all others, suggesting that state taxes significantly influence the pattern of foreign direct investment in the United States.

We construct a model of firms' technology and behavior, taking advantage of the analytical framework provided in the cost-function-based applied production-theory literature, and apply it to state-level data for U.S. manufacturing. We find that infrastructure investment provides a significant return to manufacturing firms and augments productivity growth. The net benefits of infrastructure investment may or may not be positive, depending upon the social costs of infrastructure investment and the relative growth rates of output and infrastructure.

While long terms of office for the central banker can reduce the role of electoral surprises, term lengths that are too long are costly if societal preferences are subject to permanent shifts. The appointment of a conservative central banker increases the optimal term length and leads to lower average inflation but need not increase the volatility of output.

The model on which our analysis is based treats variable capital-utilization rates as a form of factor-hoarding. We argue that variable capital-utilization rates are a quantitatively important source of propagation to business-cycle shocks. With this additional source of propagation, the volatility of exogenous technology shocks needed to explain the observed variability in aggregate U.S. output is significantly reduced relative to standard real-business-cycle models.

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

ID INFLATION; OUTPUT; MONEY; SEARCH
AB Theoretical work on price-setting behavior focuses on the single-product case while, in reality, a single price-setter sells many products. We use retail store-level multiproduct pricing data to learn about price dynamics. We find that, while the timing of a product's price changes is staggered across stores selling the same product, the timing of the price changes of different products sold within the same store is highly synchronized. This finding validates the usual assumption that decisions are staggered across price-setters and suggests that price rigidity is due mostly to ''mechanical'' reasons and not to informational asymmetries.

AB This paper develops a model in which managers voluntarily choose debt to credibly constrain their own future empire-building. Dynamically consistent capital structure is derived as the optimal response in each period of partially entrenched managers trading-off empire-building ambitions with the need to ensure sufficient efficiency to prevent control challenges. A policy of capital structure coordinated with dividends follows naturally, as do implications for the level, frequency, and maturity structure of debt as a function of outside investment opportunities. Additionally, the model yields new testable implications for security design, and changes in debt and empire-building over managerial careers.

ID RUN DATA SHOW; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; OUTPUT
AB This paper examines the role of sectors in aggregate convergence for 14 OECD countries during 1970-1987. The major finding is that manufacturing shows little evidence of either labor productivity or multifactor productivity convergence, while other sectors, especially services, are driving the aggregate convergence result. To determine the robustness of the convergence results, the paper introduces a new measure of multifactor productivity which avoids many problems inherent to traditional measures of total factor productivity when comparing productivity levels. The lack of convergence in manufacturing is robust to the method of calculating multifactor productivity.

AB This paper examines individual decision making when decisions reflect on people's ability to learn. We address this problem in the context of a manager making investment decisions on a project over time. We show that in an effort to appear as a fast learner, the manager will exaggerate his own information; but ultimately, he becomes too conservative, being unwilling to change his investments on the basis of new information. Our results arise purely from learning about competence rather than concavity or convexity of the rewards functions. We relate our results to the existing psychology literature concerning cognitive dissonance reduction.

The key feature of the model is that some assets other than money play a special role in facilitating transactions, which affects the rate of return that they offer. The model is capable of producing a low risk-free rate, a high equity premium, and an average positive relationship between maturity and term premium for default-free bonds. The model's implications for the joint distribution of asset returns, velocity, inflation, money growth, and consumption growth are also compared to the behavior of these variables in the U.S. economy.

ID IMPLICIT MARKETS; PRICE MODELS; PRODUCTIVITY; DEMAND; AGENCY; NORMS
AB A hedonic analysis of principal-agent employment contracts is developed in which workers and employers exchange labor services and contractual payment patterns. Within this framework, tests of alternative hypotheses are formulated and applied to contract data from a unique household-level survey of economic activity in rural China in 1935. The results indicate that credit market constraints motivated workers' and employers' contract choices, that shirking by workers rather than by employers was the dominant incentive issue, that reputational concerns rather than threats of termination were the key worker-disciplining device, and, finally, that the contract's third party acted as an enforcement device rather than as a matchmaker. Subject to the availability of matched agent-principal data, this structural approach to modeling agency relationships can also be used in contemporary settings.

AB We analyze how relative wage movements among birth cohorts and education groups affected the distribution of household consumption and economic welfare. Our empirical work draws on the best available cross-sectional data sets to construct synthetic panel data on U.S. consumption, labor supply, and wages during the 1980s. We find that low-frequency movements in the cohort-education structure of pretax hourly wages among men drove large changes in the distribution of household consumption. The results constitute a spectacular failure of between-group consumption insurance, a failure not explained by existing theories of informationally constrained optimal consumption behavior. A welfare analysis indicates that the cost of between-group consumption variability is larger than the cost of aggregate consumption variability by two orders of magnitude.

ID UNITED-STATES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; INFANT-MORTALITY; HEALTH COVERAGE; CARE;
   MASSACHUSETTS; OUTCOMES; ABORTION; WELFARE; IMPACT
AB A key question for health care reform in the United States is whether expanded health insurance eligibility will lead to improvements in health outcomes. We address this question in the context of the dramatic changes in Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women that took place between 1979 and 1992. We build a detailed simulation model of each state's Medicaid policy during this era and use this model to estimate (1) the effect of changes in the rules on the fraction of women eligible for Medicaid coverage in the event of pregnancy and (2) the effect of Medicaid eligibility changes on birth outcomes in aggregate Viral Statistics data. We have three main findings. First, the changes did dramatically increase the Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women, but did so at quite differential rates across the states. Second, the changes lowered the incidence of infant mortality and low birth weight; we estimate that the 30-percentage-point increase in eligibility among 15-44-year-old women was associated with a decrease in infant mortality of 8.5 percent. Third, earlier, targeted changes in Medicaid eligibility, which were restricted to specific low-income groups, had much larger effects on birth outcomes than broader expansions of eligibility to women with higher income levels. We suggest that the source of this difference is the much lower take-up of Medicaid coverage by individuals who became eligible under the broader eligibility changes. Even the targeted changes cost the Medicaid program $840,000 per infant life saved, however, raising important issues of cost effectiveness.

AB Local opposition to many projects makes it increasingly difficult to find sites for socially desirable facilities. As has been widely documented, compensation for local disamenities does not increase the level of support. An empirical analysis of the Swiss search for a nuclear waste repository even reveals decreased acceptance due to the rejection of bribes and the crowding-out of public spirit. However, a ''compensation cycle'' may be exploited to finally win the support of host communities. As siting issues are decided in the realm of politics, an economic theory of compensation must focus on the interplay between morals and markets.

ID MODELS; ESTIMATORS; SELECTION; PATTERNS
AB Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring of the telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities should they continue, depended on their productivity. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different and more plausible estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures. Using our estimates we find increases in the rate of aggregate productivity growth after deregulation. Since we have plant-level data we can introduce indices which delve deeper into how this productivity growth occurred. These indices indicate that productivity increases were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.

ID UNCERTAINTY; GROWTH
AB This is a one-agent Bayesian model of learning by doing and technology choice. The more the agent uses a technology, the better he learns its parameters, and the more productive he gets. This expertise is a form of human capital.
   Any given technology has bounded productivity, which therefore can grow in the long run only if the agent keeps switching to better technologies. But a switch of technologies temporarily reduces expertise: The bigger is the technological leap, the bigger the loss in expertise. The prospect of a productivity drop may prevent the agent from climbing the technological ladder as quickly as he might. Indeed, an agent may be so skilled at some technology that he will never switch again, so that he will experience no long-run growth. In contrast, someone who is less skilled (and therefore less productive) at that technology may find it optimal to switch technologies over and over again, and therefore enjoy long-run growth in output. Thus the model can give rise to overtaking.

ID PROOF NASH EQUILIBRIA; ELECTIONS; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB This paper extends the spatial theory of voting to an institutional structure in which policy choices depend upon not only the executive but also the composition of the legislature. Voters have incentives to be strategic since policy reflects the outcome of a simultaneous election of the legislature and the executive and since the legislature's impact on policy depends upon relative plurality. To analyze equilibrium in this game between voters, we apply ''coalition proof' type refinements. The model has several testable implications which are consistent with voting behavior in the United States. For instance, the model predicts: (a) split-tickets where some voters vote for one party for president and the other for congress; (b) for some parameter values, a divided government with different parties controlling the executive and the majority of the legislature; and (c) the midterm electoral cycle with the party holding the presidency always losing votes in midterm congressional elections.

AB This paper constructs a space of states of the world representing the exhaustive uncertainty facing each player in a strategic situation. The innovation is that preferences are restricted primarily by ''regularity'' conditions and need not conform with subjective expected utility theory. The construction employs a hierarchy of preferences, rather than of beliefs as in the standard Bayesian model. The framework is sufficiently general to accommodate uncertainty averse preferences, such as exhibited in the Ellsberg paradox, and to allow common knowledge of expected utility (or Choquet expected utility) to be well-defined formally. Applications include the provision of (i) foundations for a Harsanyi-style game of incomplete information, and (ii) a rich framework for the axiomatization of solution concepts for complete information normal form games.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This paper presents a new, probabilistic model of learning in games which investigates the often stated intuition that common knowledge of strategic intent may arise from repeated interaction. The model is set in the usual repeated game framework, but the two key assumptions are framed in terms of the likelihood of beliefs and actions conditional on the history of play. The first assumption formalizes the basic intuition of the learning approach; the second, the indeterminacy that inspired resort to learning models in the first place. Together the assumptions imply that, almost surely, play will remain almost always within one of the stage game's ''minimal inclusive sets.'' In important classes of games, including those with strategic complementarities, potential functions, and bandwagon effects, all such sets are singleton Nash.

AB Several recent papers have emphasized that long-term relationships can be efficiently governed by short-term contracts, provided that there is no asymmetric information at the contracting dates. This excludes not only adverse selection problems, but also moral hazards problems in which hidden actions generate private information over the future.
   In this paper we show, in the context of a multiperiod principal-agent relationship with adverse selection, that renegotiable short-term contracts can be as efficient as long-term renegotiation-proof contracts. On the other hand, spot contracting may fail to achieve long-run efficiency not only because of intertemporal smoothing, as with symmetric information, but also because of ratchet effects and time inconsistency in the optimal structure of informational rents. Thus some limited commitment seems to be a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve long-run efficiency.

AB We introduce and analyze ''multistage situations,'' which generalize ''multistage games'' (which, in turn, generalize ''repeated games''). One reason for this generalization is to avoid the perhaps unrealistic constraint-inherent to noncooperative games-that the set of strategy tuples must be a Cartesian product of the strategy sets of the players. Another reason is that in most economic and social activities (e.g., in sequential bargaining without a rigid protocol) the ''rules of the game'' are rather amorphous; the procedures are rarely pinned down. Such social environments can, however, be represented as multistage situations and be effectively analyzed through the theory of social situations.
   The paper contributes to the theory of social situations within the framework of multistage situations (e.g., the existence of a largest conservative stable standard of behavior which yields a definition that extends ''subgame perfect equilibrium paths''), and to the theory of multistage games (e.g., the existence of E-generalized perfect equilibrium, for all epsilon > 0). It also provides an equivalence theorem between subgame perfection and the largest conservative stable standard of behavior for multistage games. The usefulness of our approach is further illustrated by our notion of ''k-rationality'' whereby (at each substitution) players look only k steps ahead.

AB This paper examines how proportional transaction costs, short-sale constraints, and margin requirements affect inferences based on asset return data about intertemporal marginal rates of substitution (IMRSs). It is shown that small transaction costs can greatly reduce the required variability of IMRSs. This suggests that the low variability of many parametric, aggregate consumption based IMRSs need not be inconsistent with asset return data. Euler inequalities for a transaction cost economy with power utility are tested using aggregate consumption data and returns on stocks and short maturity U.S. Treasury bills. In the majority of cases there is little evidence against power utility specifications with low risk-aversion parameters. The results are obtained with transaction costs on stocks as small as .5% of price, and are in sharp contrast to the strong rejection of the analogous Euler equalities for a frictionless economy.

Information cascades generate box office 'hits' and 'flops'. The revenue distribution evolves recursively over the 'run' as a mixture of the 'opening' and a stochastic competition among films. The motion picture run is decentralised, adaptive, and self-organising: semi-stationary admission prices, local information, and contingency-rich contracts match the film rental price and the supply of theatrical engagements to demand.

Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the efficiency of in-kind transfers is examined in a microsimulation framework in which recipients are identified as those who have the lowest consumption. In this framework, in-kind transfers of food, capital services (which includes housing) and consumer services, are an effective. means of providing support to the poor even at high levels of subsidisation.

This paper analyses the effectiveness of such a policy in the context of a closed-economy, staggered-prices model. Both a permanent and a temporary rise in the interest rate on money provoke an initial fall in inflation, at the expense of a recession. When the rise is temporary, however, the initial inflation slowdown is' eventually followed by an upsurge of inflation over the level prevailing before the policy was implemented.

Uncertainty associated with the business cycle and its impact on product price generates disequilibrium wages and identifies the labour demand function in contractions and the supply of labour in expansions. The theoretical prediction of a negative relationship between real wages and employment during contractions and a positive relationship during expansions is strongly supported by the empirical evidence presented.

Sufficient conditions for positive trade linkages between labour force growth in one region and real wage erosion in another are derived. These conditions are then examined numerically in the context of projected non-OECD labour force growth.

Drawing on data from Cote d'Ivoire, it finds that urban wages are depressed by higher levels of unemployment. This result is robust to changes in model specification and level of aggregation. It is consistent with the model of wage determination developed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Blanchflower and Oswald (1995), but not with claims that urban wages are invariant to unemployment.

AB Using a hitherto neglected source of data, this paper combines executive emoluments with executive share options to construct a broader measure of executive pay than has been possible in earlier British studies. The result of including the long-term share option component of pay along with the more commonly utilised short-term component of emoluments is to reveal executive pay as being significantly more sensitive to company performance than has previously been thought to be the case. The paper questions the current policy stance of British institutional investors and of the Greenbury Committee with respect to executive share options.

ID DYNAMIC OLIGOPOLY; COMPETITION; DEMAND
AB This paper studies the benefits of staggered wage setting in reducing strategic conflicts. It is shown that when wage setters interact strategically and dynamically, they prefer moving alternatingly, because by doing so, they are able to commit temporarily not to offset the effects of each other's action. It is also shown that synchronisation represents a better arrangement when agents are able to coordinate. These results are consistent with the presence of non-synchronous and decentralised wage decisions in the United States and the United Kingdom and the presence of synchronous bargaining (in Shunto) and coordination in wage determination in Japan.

AB We study a barter economy in which each good is produced in two qualities and no trader can distinguish between the qualities of those goods he neither consumes nor produces. We show that in competitive equilibrium there exists a (unique) good-the one for which the discrepancy between qualities is smallest-that serves as the medium of exchange: this good mediates every trade. Equilibrium is inefficient because production of the medium would be lower if it were not for its mediating role. Introducing fiat money enhances welfare by eliminating this distortion. However, high inflation drives traders back to the commodity medium.

AB We develop a dynamic model of learning about worker ability in a competitive labor market. The model produces three testable implications regarding wage dynamics: (1) although the role of schooling in the labor market's inference process declines as performance observations accumulate, the estimated effect of schooling on the level of wages is independent of labor-market experience; (2) time-invariant variables correlated with ability but unobserved by employers (such as certain test scores) are increasingly correlated with wages as experience increases; and (3) wage residuals are a martingale. We present evidence from the NLSY that is broadly consistent with the model's predictions.

AB Historically, lenders have been accused of ''redlining'' minority neighborhoods as well as refusing to lend to minority applicants. Considerable bank regulation is designed to prevent both actions. However, the strong correlation between race and neighborhood makes it difficult to distinguish the impact of geographic discrimination from the effects of racial discrimination. Previous studies have failed to untangle these two influences, in part, because of severe omitted variable bias. The data set in this paper allows the distinct effects of race and geography to be identified, and it shows that the evidence for redlining is weak.

We find that 39 percent of shocks to gross state product are smoothed by capital markets, 13 percent are smoothed by the federal government, and 23 percent are smoothed by credit markets. The remaining 25 percent are not smoothed. We also decompose the federal government smoothing into subcategories: taxes, transfers, and grants to states.

Small differences in prior beliefs lead to large speculative premiums during the learning process. This phenomenon helps explain a paradox concerning the pricing of initial public offerings. The result casts light on the significance of the common prior assumption in economic models.

AB Arbitrage costs lead to large deviations of prices from fundamentals. Using a sample of closed-end funds, I find that the market value of a fund is more likely to deviate from the value of its assets (1) for funds with portfolios that are difficult to replicate, (2) for funds that pay out smaller dividends, (3) for funds with lower market values, and (4) when interest rates are high. These factors are related to the magnitude of the deviation, as opposed to the direction (i.e., whether discount or premium), and explain a quarter of cross-sectional mispricing variation. These findings are consistent with noise trader models of asset pricing.

AB This paper provides a new perspective on the validity of the so-called ''leverage theory.'' In a model of preemptive innovation in ''systems'' markets, I examine the effect of bundling on R&D incentives. I find that bundling provides a channel through which monopoly ''slack'' in one component market can be shifted to another, with the effect of mitigating rent dissipation in the systems market. Bundling can be profitable if this beneficial effect of reduced rent dissipation outweighs the negative effect of intensified price competition. After demonstrating the private optimality of bundling, its welfare implications are considered. Finally, the results can be reinterpreted to analyze the relationship between compatibility decisions and R&D incentives in mix-and-match models.

When coupled with rational expectations, however, empirical renderings of the model fail miserably. I explore the possibility that failure to account for changes in monetary policy regime explains much of the failure of the PEH. Estimating changing monetary regimes in conjunction with the PEH significantly improves its performance. The predicted spread between the long and short rates is highly correlated with the actual spread. The standard deviation of the theoretical spread is nearly identical to that of the actual spread.

AB Using a panel of 51 prices from 48 cities in the United States, we provide an upper bound estimate of the rate of convergence to purchasing power parity. We find convergence rates substantially higher than typically found in cross-country data. We investigate some potentially serious biases induced by i.i.d. measurement errors in the data, and find our estimates to be robust to these potential biases. We also present evidence that convergence occurs faster for larger price differences. Finally, we find that rates of convergence are slower for cities farther apart. However, our estimates suggest that distance alone can only account for a small portion of the much slower convergence rates across national borders.

AB Targeted tax-based saving incentives can be a powerful tool for promoting household and national saving. This study examines the effect of the cancellation of the Registered Home Ownership Savings Plan (RHOSP), a Canadian tax-subsidized saving program, on household saving. The cancellation provides exogenous variation in eligibility for the subsidy that is uncorrelated with household-specific heterogeneity in saving behavior. The empirical analysis suggests that the subsidy had a substantial impact on saving: each dollar contributed to the program represented 56-93 and 20-57 cents of new household and national saving, respectively.

TI The role of premarket factors in black-white wage differences
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

DT Article
ID RELATIVE EARNINGS; SCHOOL QUALITY; DISCRIMINATION; MEN; EDUCATION; 1980S
AB Many attempts to measure the wage effects of current labor market discrimination against minorities include controls for worker productivity that (1) could themselves be affected by market discrimination and (2) are very imprecise measures of worker skill. The resulting estimates of residual wage gaps may be biased. Our approach is a parsimoniously specified wage equation that controls for skill with the score of a test administered as teenagers prepared to leave high school and embark on work careers or postsecondary education. Independent evidence shows that this test score is a racially unbiased measure of the skills and abilities these teenagers were about to bring to the labor market. We find that this one test score explains all of the black-white wage gap for young women and much of the gap for young men. For today's young adults, the black-white wage gap primarily reflects a skill gap, which in turn we can trace, at least in part, to observable differences in the family backgrounds

AB By buying cheap and selling dear, risk-neutral commodity speculators can smooth commodity pr-ices and induce serial dependence in price even when none would exist under a simple process of supply and demand, Commodity prices are variable and strongly positively correlated from one year to the next. The variability is often explained by supply factors, and the autocorrelation by the activities of speculators. We show that this explanation is not consistent with the evidence. Speculation tan substantially increase autocorrelation for prices that are weakly autocorrelated in its absence, but not to the high levels that are observed in the data.

AB This paper studies the price fluctuations of storable commodities that are traded in open markets and are subject to random shocks to demand or, more particularly, to supply. It relaxes the common assumption that the shocks are identically and independently distributed in favor of temporally dependent and periodic disturbances. The existence of a unique stationary rational expectations equilibrium is demonstrated for each of the models analyzed, and testable implications of the models are derived. An illustrative empirical investigation is then undertaken for the model with periodic disturbances using monthly time-series observations for seven commodities over the period 1960-93.

AB Objective measures of employee performance are rarely available, Instead, firms rely on subjective judgments by supervisors. Subjectivity opens the door to favoritism, where evaluators acton personal preferences toward subordinates to favor some employees over others, Firms must balance the costs of favoritism-arbitrary rewards and less productive job assignments-against supervisors' demands for authority over subordinates. We analyze the conditions under which favoritism is costly to organizations and the effects of favoritism on compensation, the optimal extent of authority, and the use of bureaucratic rules.

ID MOBILITY; LESSONS
AB The paper studies the political and economic determinants of regional public transfers. Specifically, it focuses on how such transfers are shaped by alternative fiscal constitutions, where a constitution is an allocation of fiscal instruments across different levels of governments plus a procedure for the collective choice of these instruments. Realistic restrictions on fiscal instruments introduce a tradeoff between risk sharing and redistribution. Different constitutions produce very different results. In particular, a federal social insurance scheme, chosen by voting, provides overinsurance, whereas an intergovernmental transfer scheme, chosen by bargaining, provides underinsurance.

AB Virtually all models of the household assume that the allocation of resources is Pareto efficient. Within many African households, agricultural production occurs on many plots controlled by different members of the household. Pareto efficiency implies that factors should be allocated efficiently across these plots. I find, in contrast, that plots controlled by women are farmed much less intensively than similar plots within the household controlled by men. The estimates imply that about 6 percent of output is lost because of inefficient factor allocation within the household. The paper suggests a new approach to modeling intrahousehold allocation consistent with the empirical results.

Agents are assumed unable to borrow to fund the human capital investment needed to become managers. Despite ex ante identical agents, the model displays the following equilibrium phenomena: (i) risk-averse agents accept fair gambles, implying an unequal ex post distribution of unearned income; (ii) agents agree to publicly subsidize education, although those receiving the subsidy have the highest material wealth; and (iii) income and educational differences are perpetuated from generation to generation.

AB Inferences about the effects of money on economic activity may depend importantly on the choice of a monetary index because simple-sum aggregates cannot internalize pure substitution effects. This hypothesis is investigated by replicating five recent studies that have challenged an aspect of the ''conventional wisdom'' about the effects of money on aggregate activity. In four of the five cases, the qualitative inference in the original study is reversed when a simple-sum monetary aggregate is replaced by a Divisia index of the same asset collection. The results are mixed in the fifth case.

AB To what extent can agents' learning and incomplete information about the ''true'' underlying model generating stock returns explain findings of excess volatility and predictability of returns in the stock market? In this paper we analyse two models of recursive learning in the stock market when dividends follow a (trend-)stationary autoregressive process. The asymptotic convergence properties of the models are characterized and we decompose the variation in stock prices into rational expectations and recursive learning components with different rates of convergence. A present-value learning rule is found to generate substantial excess volatility in stock prices even in very large samples, and also seems capable of explaining the positive correlation between stock returns and the lagged dividend yield. Self-referential learning, where agents' learning affect the law of motion of the process they are estimating, is shown to generate some additional volatility in stock prices, though of a magnitude much smaller than present value learning.

ID SEARCH MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; COMPETITION; ASK
AB A model of market making by firms with heterogeneous consumers, suppliers and price-setting intermediaries is examined. Consumers and suppliers engage in time-consuming search for the best price and discount future returns. There exists a unique symmetric equilibrium pricing strategy. In equilibrium, there are non-degenerate distributions of ask and bid prices that straddle the Walrasian price. As the discount rate goes to zero, the ranges of the bid and ask prices, and the total output approach the Walrasian equilibrium values. As the discount rate becomes targe, the ask and bid prices approach the monopoly pricing policies. An increase in the discount rate leads to an increase in the equilibrium number of active firms, profit per firm, the mean spread between ask and bid prices, and the variance of ask and bid prices, while lowering the number of active consumers and suppliers. The model is extended to examine the steady-state market equilibrium with continual entry and exit of consumers and suppliers.

ID IRREVERSIBILITY
AB Investment is characterized by costly reversibility when a firm can purchase capital at a given price and sell capital at a lower price. We solve for the optimal investment of a firm that faces costly reversibility under uncertainty and we extend the Jorgensonian concept of the user cost of capital to this case. We define and calculate c(V) and c(L) as the user costs of capital associated with the purchase and sale of capital, respectively. Optimality requires the firm to purchase and sell capital as needed to keep the marginal revenue product of capital in the closed interval [c(L), c(U)]. This prescription encompasses the case of irreversible investment as well as the standard neoclassical case of costlessly reversible investment.

This paper considers if and when imperfect diversification is a feature of efficient allocations in a symmetric information environment without commitment. It shows that if individuals are sufficiently patient, imperfect diversification is always sub-optimal in the long run; however, if individuals are not so patient, imperfect diversification is always optimal. The paper goes on to demonstrate that the way that history matters in an efficient allocation in a symmetric-information/no-commitment environment can be used to distinguish lack of commitment from other possible rationalizations of imperfect risk sharing, such as efficiency in the presence of asymmetric information.

AB This paper explores the effect of policy variability (or frequency of regime switching) on economic growth and welfare. We study a one-sector growth model where investment can be subsidized at either a positive rate or not subsidized at all. We find that the lack of persistence in policies per se need not be welfare reducing and that it is likely to decrease growth. Higher variability implies more frequent changes in consumption and investment. But, by creating a stronger intertemporal link across regimes, variability reduces the fluctuation in investment rates, thus decreasing the magnitude of changes in consumption and increasing welfare.

AB This paper examines the competition between money and credit in a search model with divisible commodities. It is shown that fiat money can be valuable even though it yields a lower rate of return than the coexisting credit. The competition between money and credit increases efficiency. The monetary equilibrium with credit Pareto dominates the monetary equilibrium without credit whenever the two coexist. When a credit is repaid with money, the competition also bounds the purchasing power of money from below by that of credit and so eliminates the weak inefficient monetary equilibrium found in previous search models. With numerical examples, three different monetary equilibria are ranked and the properties of the interest rate are examined.

DT Article
ID RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET
AB Convergence to a full-information equilibrium (FIE) in the presence of persistent shocks and asymmetric information about an unknown payoff-relevant parameter theta is established in a classical infinite-horizon partial equilibrium linear model. It is found that, under the usual stability assumptions on the autoregressive process of shocks, convergence occurs at the rate n(-1/2), where n is the number of rounds of trade, and that the asymptotic variance of the discrepancy of the full-information price and the market price is independent of the degree of autocorrelation of the shocks. This is so even though the speed of learning theta from prices becomes arbitrarily slow as autocorrelation approaches a unit root level. It follows then that learning the unknown parameter theta and convergence of the equilibrium process to the FIE are not equivalent. Moreover, allowing for non-stationary processes of shocks, the distinction takes a more stark form. Learning theta is neither necessary nor sufficient for convergence to the FIE. When the process of shocks has a unit root, convergence to the FIE occurs but theta can not be learned. When the process is sufficiently explosive and there is a positive mass of perfectly informed agents, theta is learned quickly but convergence to the FIE does not occur.

We analyze this feedback in the context of a monetary authority's attempt to stimulate an economy in recession. We show that modest stimuli may prove ineffectual. If small reductions in interest rates are unlikely to promote a response, then they may be followed by further cuts. A vicious circle develops in which the expectation that the policy could fail leads investors to delay investment thereby promoting failure.

AB During recessions, output prices seem to rise relative to wages and raw-material prices. One explanation is that imperfectly competitive firms compete less aggressively during recessions. That is, markups of price otter marginal cost are countercyclical. We present a model of countercyclical markups based on capital-market imperfections. During recessions, liquidity-constrained firms boost short-run profits by raising prices to cut their investments in market share. We provide evidence from the supermarket industry in support of this theory. During regional and macroeconomic recessions, more financially constrained supermarket chains raise their prices relative to less financially constrained chains.

AB This paper introduces two arbitrage-based tests of target-zone credibility using a new data source, ERM cross-rate options. Using daily option prices from September 1991 to August 1994, we assess the credibility of the pound-mark and mark-lira target zones that collapsed in September 1992, and the ongoing mark-French franc target zone. These tests are based on restrictions that must apply to all option prices within a credible target zone, and are free from specification error and estimation error. We also identify a minimum ''intensity of realignment,'' an expression indicating the probability-weighted average realignment size.

AB Most analyses treat global warming as a single-agent problem. The present study presents the Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE) model. By disaggregating into countries, the model analyzes different national strategies in climate-change policy: pure market solutions, efficient cooperative outcomes, and noncooperative equilibria. This study finds that cooperative policies show much higher levels of emissions reductions than do noncooperative strategies, that there are substantial differences in the levels of controls iii both the cooperative and the noncooperative policies among different countries; and that high-income countries may be the major losers from cooperation.

AB The problem of extracting commonly owned renewable resources is examined within an evolutionary-game-theoretic framework. It is shown that cooperative behavior guided by norms of restraint and punishment may be stable in a well-defined sense against invasion by narrowly self-interested behavior. The resource-stock dynamics are integrated with the evolutionary-game dynamics. Effects of changes in prices, technology, and social cohesion on extraction behavior and the long-run stock are analyzed. When threshold values of the parameters are crossed, social norms can break down leading generally to the lowering of the long-run stock, and possibly to its extinction.

AB This paper examines effects of ground-level ozone regulation on economic activity. Regulatory effort varies by county attainment status and state attitudes. A switch from attainment to nonattainment status induces greater local regulatory effort, leading to air quality improvement, ceteris paribus, and an exit of polluting industries. Polluting industries spread out, moving from nonattainment (polluted) to attainment (initially less polluted) areas. Localities can improve hourly extreme-value reading which trigger regulatory activity, without improving measures of typical conditions (for example, daily medians), by spreading economic activity over the day to dampen daily ozone peaks.

AB Reciprocal exchange, or gift exchange, remains a widespread means of obtaining goods and services. This paper examines the persistence of reciprocal exchange by formalizing the interaction between self-enforcing exchange agreements and monetary market exchange. When more people engage in reciprocal exchange, market search costs increase, reciprocity is easier to enforce and yields higher utility. Thus, personalized exchange can persist even when it is inefficient. Conversely, large markets can destroy reciprocity when reciprocal exchange is efficient. The results characterized the use of personal ''connections'' as a system of reciprocal exchange and explain the disappearance of reciprocity when tribes encounter markets.

ID TRANSFERS; WEALTH; FAMILY; INCOME
AB That parents transfer resources to children because of altruistic concern is a reasonable a priori assumption. However, economic theories of altruistic transfers have produced many counterintuitive conclusions, and, consequently, much debate. When applied to bequests, these theories predict that inheritances will compensate for earnings differences between siblings as well as between parents and children. This paper tests these implications. Using a new data set centered on federal estate tax returns, little support can be found for an altruistic theory of bequests. This finding has implications for macroeconomic policy, government transfer programs, and inequality.

It employs data from a 1988 survey of TIAA-CREF annuitants designed to measure pension and other net worth, as well as lifetime earnings. About half of the households in the data plan to leave estates, and we find that their behavior conforms with theoretical altruistic models. For the same families, the amount of wealth which we attribute to estate building is large. Nevertheless, altruism towards one's children does not seem to be the major explanation of saving in the overall sample.

AB We study a dynamic model of labor migration in which moving costs decrease with the number of migrants already settled in the destination. This assumption is supported by sociological studies of migrant networks. With endogenous moving costs migration occurs gradually over time. Once it starts, it develops momentum, and migratory flows may increase even as wage differentials narrow, In addition, migration tends to follow geographical channels, and low-moving-cost individuals migrate first. These patterns are consistent with historical evidence from the Great Black Migration of 1915-1960, much of which cannot be reconciled with existing migration models.

The results indicate that the returns to (primary) schooling increased during a period of rapid technical progress, particularly in areas with the highest growth rates. Such increases induced private investment in schooling, net of changes in wealth, wages, and the availability of schools, and school expansion importantly increased levels of schooling.

AB The television game show The Price Is Right is used as a laboratory to conduct a preference-free test of rational decision theory in an environment with substantial economic incentives. It is found that contestants' strategies are transparently suboptimal. In response to this evidence, simple rules of thumb are developed which are shown to explain observed bidding patterns better than rational decision theory. Further, learning during the show reduces the frequency of strategic errors. This is interpreted as evidence of bounded rationality. Finally, there is no evidence that a concern for fairness significantly alters bidding behavior.

The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.

ID CHANGE-POINT; TIME-SERIES; TESTS; REGRESSION; STABILITY
AB Contemporary tests for structural change deal with detections of the ''one-shot'' type: given an historical data set of fixed size, these tests are designed to detect a structural break within the data set. Due to the law of the iterated logarithm, one-shot tests cannot be applied to monitor out-of-sample stability each time new data arrive without signalling a nonexistent break with probability one. We propose and analyze two realtime monitoring procedures with controlled size asymptotically: the fluctuation and CUSUM monitoring procedures. We extend an invariance principle in the sequential testing literature to obtain our results. Simulation results show that the proposed monitoring procedures indeed have controlled asymptotic size. Detection timing depends on the magnitude of parameter change, the signal to noise ratio, and the location of the out-of-sample break point.

AB This paper develops procedures for inference about the moments of smooth functions of out-of-sample predictions and prediction errors, when there is a long time series of predictions and realizations. The aim is to provide tools for analysis of predictive accuracy and efficiency, and, more generally, of predictive ability. The paper allows for nonnested and nonlinear models, as well as for possible dependence of predictions and prediction errors on estimated regression parameters. Simulations indicate that the procedures can work well in samples of size typically available.

One of the optimal tests for two-sided alternatives is the GMM generalization of the test presented in Andrews and Ploberger (1994) for the likelihood framework. The new tests include a class of optimal tests that direct the test's power to specific locations in the sample. One of these optimal tests has the attractive feature of a normal distribution under the null hypothesis.

LA English

DE risk vulnerability; background risk; incomplete markets; risk aversion
ID ASSET PRICES; AVERSION; INSURANCE
AB We examine in this paper a new natural restriction on utility functions, namely that adding an unfair background risk to wealth makes risk-averse individuals behave in a more risk-averse way with respect to any other independent risk. This concept is called risk vulnerability. It is equivalent to the condition that an undesirable risk can never be made desirable by the presence of an independent, unfair risk. Moreover, under risk vulnerability, adding an unfair background risk reduces the demand for risky assets. Risk vulnerability generalizes the concept of properness (individually undesirable, independent risks are always jointly undesirable) introduced by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987). It implies that the two first derivatives of the utility function are concave transformations of the original utility function. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, a sufficient condition for risk vulnerability is local properness, i.e. r '' r'r, where r is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion.

AB We consider the situation where a single consumer buys a stream of goods from different sellers over time. The true value of each seller's product to the buyer is initially unknown. Additional information can be gained only by experimentation. For exogeneously given prices the buyer's problem is a multi-armed bandit problem. The innovation in this paper is to endogenize the cost of experimentation to the consumer by allowing for price competition between the sellers. The role of prices is then to allocate intertemporally the costs and benefits of learning between buyer and sellers. We examine how strategic aspects of the oligopoly model interact with the learning process.
   All Markov perfect equilibria (MPE) are efficient. We identify an equilibrium which besides its unique robustness properties has a strikingly simple, seemingly myopic pricing rule. Prices below marginal cost emerge naturally to sustain experimentation. Intertemporal exchange of the gains of learning is necessary to support efficient experimentation. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the equilibria.

AB We propose a method to test for liquidity constraints which relies on using the within period marginal rate of substitution condition as a benchmark to evaluate the intertemporal Euler equation. If spot markets for nondurable goods exist, but financial markets either do not exist, or are imperfect, we show how the comparison of first order conditions involving the relevant spot and intertemporal prices can be used to detect the imperfection. We apply our methodology to a large sample of U.S. households, drawn from twelve years of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, allowing for a general nonseparable preference structure. Our estimates of first order conditions do not indicate the presence of liquidity constraints, with the possible exception of young households.

AB In this paper, we define different concepts of noncausality for continuous-time processes, using conditional independence and decomposition of semi-martingales. These definitions extend the ones already given in the case of discrete-time processes. As in the discrete-time setup, continuous-time noncausality is a property concerned with the prediction horizon (global versus instantaneous noncausality) and the nature of the prediction (strong versus weak noncausality). Relations between the resulting continuous-time noncausality concepts are then studied for the class of decomposable semi-martingales, for which, in general, the weak instantaneous noncausality does not imply the strong global noncausality. The paper then characterizes these different concepts of noncausality in the cases of counting processes and Markov processes.

AB This paper explores an approach to social choice which is an alternative to Arrow's social welfare function. We consider 'best fit' social rankings for any individual preferences through the definition of levels of agreement between preferences and rankings. We thereby avoid the pairwise approach of Arrow's independence and Pareto conditions, and we demonstrate the possibility of non-dictatorial social choice. Mie consider the rationality implications of a non-unique outcome, and determine additional properties, including majority-consistency, of the Condorcet process for determining the rankings. The approach also allows an interpretation of Sen's 'impossibility of a Paretian liberal' in terms of individual agreement.

AB Using data for the United Kingdom, we show that investors in six different wealth ranges hold mean-variance efficient portfolios of financial assets. This result permits us to estimate coefficients of relative risk aversion for investors in each wealth range. We find that these coefficients are much higher than most previous studies have found. This implies that investors (i) are unwilling to hold risky assets unless they are compensated with a sufficiently high risk premium and (ii) are willing to pay for portfolio insurance. The general non-availability of portfolio insurance in the United Kingdom appears to indicate a supply-side rather than a demand-side failure.

AB This paper gauges the strength of precautionary saving motives by estimating the coefficient of prudence from the UK Family Expenditure Survey data set (a time series of cross-sections). The instrumental variables estimates reveal that greater uncertainty systematically leads to larger current saving. Most of these impacts are large enough to be statistically consistent with widely accepted beliefs about attitudes towards risk, so that precautionary saving behaviour cannot be refuted. Moreover, the households which are less likely to face liquidity constraints or to share risks are more sensitive to uncertainty. Finally, the households for which the head works in the manufacturing industry are more inclined to self-insure against uncertainty.

ID PRICE
AB The exact measurement of the welfare costs of tax and price reform requires a detailed knowledge of individual preferences. Typically, first order approximations of welfare costs are calculated avoiding detailed knowledge of substitution effects. We drive second order approximations which, unlike first order approximations, require knowledge of the distribution of substitution elasticities. This paper asks to what extent simple approximations can be used to measure the welfare costs of tax reform and evaluates the magnitude of the biases for a plausible size tax reform. In our empirical examples first order approximations display systematic biases; second order approximations always work well.

ID TESTS; AGE
AB We use a dataset or 87,000 independent UK companies to investigate the relationship between firm size and growth. For the sample as a whole, a Galton-Markov model of regression towards the mean shows that growth is negatively related to initial size. However, when the sample is broken down by size group, we find that regression towards the mean only occurs For the smallest firms, e.g. those with eight employees or less, For larger firms, there is essentially no relationship between growth and size. Even for the smallest firm, our results may be due to transitory factors.

AB Using a large random sample of UK startups and a rich data set, the paper demonstrates that human capital is the 'true' determinant of survival and that the correlation between financial capital and survival is spurious. Provision of finance is demand-driven, with banks supplying funds elastically and business requests governing takeup. Firms self-select for funds on the basis of the human capital endowments of the proprietors with 'better' businesses more likely to borrow. A reason why others have seemingly identified startup debt-gaps may be the failure to test a sufficiently rich empirical model.

TI Optimal reservation prices in auctions
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMON-VALUE AUCTIONS; INFORMATION; DESIGN
AB The risk-neutral independent-private-values (IPV) auction model produces curious results regarding the use of reservation prices: no matter how many bidders, the seller should announce a fixed reservation price above his true value. This is notable since the seller gains by adopting an inefficient institution, and puzzling because it conflicts with common practice. We relax the IPV assumption, characterise optimal reservation prices in a richer class of auctions, and show that when information is correlated the seller's optimal reservation price converges to his true value, often monotonically and rapidly, as the number of bidders grows.

ID IMPERFECT COMPETITION; TAXATION; FEATURES; MODELS
AB We extend macroeconomic models of imperfect competition with Keynesian features to allow for non-unitary elasticities between leisure and consumption and the effect of product variety on multipliers and welfare. Provided preference For diversity is sufficiently strong, the real national income multiplier for a given rise in real public spending is larger under free than under restricted entry and exit of firms. This implies a pro-cyclical real consumer wage. With lump-sum taxes the marginal cost of public funds is below unity. Optimal public spending may be counter-cyclical. More priority for public goods raises the long-run cost of public funds.

ID INNOVATION; INTEGRATION; MARKETS
AB This paper analyses the effects of standards on UK trade performance. The results suggest that UK strength in standards improves the UK trade balance, but can also act to make the UK market more open. The results also contradict two common views of the effects of standards standards: first, that standards activity in one country is cancelled out by competing standards activity in another; and second, that international standards are the only ones that give trade advantage while 'idiosyncratic' national standards are largely irrelevant. The findings indicate that standards promote intra-industry trade, and that 'idiosyncratic' standards can promote exports.

Furthermore, the existing empirical evidence on this question is weak. However, the results reported here, based on an analysis of around 670 U.K. companies, do provide some support for this view, Most important, I present evidence that competition, as measured by increased numbers of competitors or by lower levels of rents, is associated with a significantly higher rate of total Factor productivity growth.

ID TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; INSURANCE
AB Willingness to pay (WTP), most economists believe, is an appropriate benefits metric for government expenditure and regulatory policies that reduce risks to human life. It depends, however, on the distribution of risk and wealth. Currently, society's expenditures overemphasize concentrated risks, say after-the-fact treatment as opposed to prevention. A ''dead-anyway'' effect complements excess attention to intense interests in explaining this. Our normative criterion for spending on risk reduction is what a rational, albeit uninsured, individual confronting lotteries on future risks to life and wealth would choose for himself. This requires correcting WTP to eliminate the dead-anyway effect but continues to reflect that wealth enhances the utility of living.

AB We use a survey of 452 Russian shops, most of which were privatized between 1992 and 1993, to measure the importance of alternative channels through which privatization promotes restructuring. Restructuring is measured as major renovation, a change in suppliers, an increase in hours stores stay open, and layoffs. There is strong evidence that the presence of new owners and new managers raises the likelihood of restructuring. In contrast, there is no evidence that equity incentives of old managers promote restructuring. The evidence points to the critical role new human capital plays in economic transformation.

We find that the greater overall U.S. wage dispersion primarily reflects substantially more compression at the bottom of the wage distribution in the other countries. While differences in the distribution of measured characteristics help to explain some aspects of the international differences, higher U.S. prices (i.e., rewards to skills and rents) are an important factor. Labor market institutions, chiefly the relatively decentralized wage-setting mechanisms iri the United States, provide the most persuasive explanation for these patterns.

We show that equilibrium exists and is efficient and that it gives rise to a unique distribution of the social surplus. We show further that the equilibrium wage is determined by three factors. Consideration of these factors allows us to determine when and how the market mechanism enables the worker to capture some of the returns to firm-specific human capital, We relate our findings to the ongoing empirical debate concerning the return to tenure.

We find that the rates of real, per capita growth in income and output increase significantly following intrastate branch reform. We also argue that the observed changes in growth are the result of changes in the banking system. Improvements in the quality of bank lending, not increased volume of bank lending, appear to be responsible for faster growth.

TI How teachers' unions affect education production
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL QUALITY
AB This study helps to explain why measured school inputs appear to have little effect on student outcomes, particularly for cohorts educated since 1960. Teachers' unionization can explain how public schools simultaneously can have more generous inputs and worse student performance. Using panel data on United States school districts, I identify the effect of teachers' unionization through differences in the timing of collective bargaining, especially timing determined by the passage of state laws that facilitate teachers' unionization. I find that teachers' unions increase school inputs but reduce productivity sufficiently to have a negative overall effect on student performance. Union effects are magnified where schools have market power.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID REAL BUSINESS CYCLES; MARGINAL COST; PRICE
AB This paper investigates the relative importance of cyclical fluctuations in labor and capital utilization, increasing returns to scale, and technology shocks as explanations for procyclical productivity. It exploits the intuition that materials inputs do not have variable utilization rates, and materials are likely to be used in fixed proportions with value added. Therefore, materials growth is a good measure of unobserved changes in capital and labor utilization. Using this measure shows that cyclical factor utilization is very important, returns to scale are about constant, and technology shocks are small and have low correlation with either output or hours growth.

AB Capital investment decisions must recognize the limitations on the firm's ability to later sell or expand capacity. This paper shows how opportunities for future expansion or contraction can be valued as options, how their valuation relates to the q theory of investment, and their effect on the incentive to invest. Generally, the option to expand reduces the incentive to invest, while the option to disinvest raises it. We show how these options determine the effect of uncertainty on investment, how they are changed by shifts of the distribution of future profitability, and how the q-theory and option pricing approaches are related.

The underlying mechanism is a pecuniary externality due to the interaction of ex ante investments and costly bilateral search in the labor market. It is shown that the equilibrium rate of return on the human capital of a worker is increasing in the average human capital of the workforce even though all the production functions in the economy exhibit constant returns to scale, there are no technological externalities, and all workers are competing for the same jobs.

TI On the timing and efficiency of creative destruction
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR; JOB CREATION; UNEMPLOYMENT; GROWTH; FLOWS
AB We analyze the timing, pace, and efficiency of ongoing job reallocation that results from product and process innovation. There are strong reasons why an efficient economy ought to concentrate both job creation and destruction during recessions, when the opportunity cost of reallocation is lowest. Incomplete contracting between labor and capital can disrupt this synchronized pattern and decouple creation and destruction. Transactional difficulties also lead to technological ''sclerosis,'' characterized by excessively slow renovation. Government incentives to production may alleviate high unemployment but exacerbate sclerosis. In contrast, creation incentives increase the pace of reallocation. An optimal combination of both policies restores economic efficiency.

TI Wage stickiness and aggregate supply in the great depression
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Building on earlier work by Eichengreen and Sachs, we use data for 22 countries to study the role of wage stickiness in propagating the Great Depression. Recent research suggests that monetary shocks, transmitted internationally by the gold standard, were a major cause of the Depression. Accordingly, we use money supplies and other aggregate demand shifters as instruments to identify aggregate supply relationships. We find that nominal wages adjusted quite slowly to falling prices, and that the resulting increases in real wages depressed output. These findings leave open the question of why wages were so inertial in the face of extreme labor market conditions.

AB We show that a manufacturer facing uncertain demand and selling through a competitive retail market may wish to support adequate retail inventories by preventing the emergence of discount retailers. In our model, discounters offer low prices made possible by low probability of being saddled with unsold inventories in the event of slack demand. Full-price retailers are compensated for a higher probability of unsold inventories by a higher retail price when they sell. We show that preventing discounting increases the manufacturer's wholesale demand and profits, and we delineate demand conditions under which equilibrium inventory holding and consumer welfare increase.

AB Our general subject is model determination methods and their use in the prediction of economic time series. The methods suggested are Bayesian in spirit but they can be justified by classical as well as Bayesian arguments. The main part of the paper is concerned with model determination, forecast evaluation, and the construction of evolving sequences of models that can adapt in dimension and form (including the way in which any nonstationarity in the data is modelled) as new characteristics in the data become evident. The paper continues some recent work on Bayesian asymptotics by the author and Werner Ploberger (1995), develops embedding techniques for vector martingales that justify the role of a class of exponential densities in model selection and forecast evaluation, and implements the modelling ideas in a multivariate regression framework that includes Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVAR's) and reduced rank regressions (RRR's). It is shown how the theory in the paper can be used: (i) to construct optimized BVAR's with data-determined hyperparameters; (ii) to compare models such as BVAR's, optimized BVAR's, and RRR's; (iii) to perform joint order selection of cointegrating rank, lag length, and trend degree in a VAR; and (iv) to discard data that may be irrelevant and thereby reset the initial conditions of a model.

AB The asymptotic power envelope is derived for point-optimal tests of a unit root in the autoregressive representation of a Gaussian time series under various trend specifications. We propose a family of tests whose asymptotic power functions are tangent to the power envelope at one point and are never far below the envelope. When the series has no deterministic component, some previously proposed tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to members of this family. When the series has an unknown mean or linear trend, commonly used tests are found to be dominated by members of the family of point-optimal invariant tests. We propose a modified version of the Dickey-Fuller t test which has substantially improved power when an unknown mean or trend is present. A Monte Carlo experiment indicates that the modified test works well in small samples.

AB This paper proposes three classes of consistent one-sided tests for serial correlation of unknown form for the residual from a linear dynamic regression model that includes both lagged dependent variables and exogenous variables. The tests are obtained by comparing a kernel-based normalized spectral density estimator and the null normalized spectral density, using a quadratic norm, the Hellinger metric, and the Kullback-Leibler information criterion respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation, the three classes of new test statistics are asymptotically N(0,1) and equivalent. The null distributions are obtained without having to specify any alternative model. Unlike some conventional tests for serial correlation, the null distributions of our tests remain invariant when the regressors include lagged dependent variables. Under a suitable class of local alternatives, the three classes of the new tests are asymptotically equally efficient. Under global alternatives, however, their relative efficiencies depend on the relative magnitudes of the three divergence measures. Our approach provides an interpretation for Box and Pierce's (1970) test, which can be viewed as a quadratic norm based test using a truncated periodogram. Many kernels deliver tests with better power than Box and Pierce's test or the truncated kernel based test. A simulation study shows that the new tests have good power against an AR(1) process and a fractionally integrated process. In particular, they have better power than the Lagrange multiplier tests of Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (1978) as well as the portmanteau tests of Box and Pierce (1970) and Ljung and Box (1978). The cross-validation procedure of Beltrao and Bloomfield (1987) and Robinson (1991a) works reasonably well in determining the smoothing parameter of the kernel spectral estimator and is recommended for use in practice.

These include tests for the significance of a subset of regressors and tests for the specification of the semiparametric functional form of the regression function, where the latter covers tests for a partially linear and a single index specification against a general nonparametric alternative. One common feature to the construction of all these tests is the use of the Central Limit Theorem for degenerate U-statistics of order higher than two. As a result, they share the same advantages over most of the corresponding existing tests in the literature: (a) They do not depend on any ad hoc modifications such as sample splitting, random weighting, etc. (b) Under the alternative hypotheses, the test statistics in this paper diverge to positive infinity at a faster rate than those based on ad hoc modifications.

AB Monte Carlo experiments have shown that tests based on generalized-method-of-moments estimators often have true levels that differ greatly from their nominal levels when asymptotic critical values are used. This paper gives conditions under which the bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements to the critical values of t tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions. Particular attention is given to the case of dependent data. It is shown that with such data, the bootstrap must sample blocks of data and that the formulae for the bootstrap versions of test statistics differ from the formulae that apply with the original data. The results of Monte Carlo experiments on the numerical performance of the bootstrap show that it usually reduces the errors in level that occur when critical values based on first-order asymptotic theory are used. The bootstrap also provides an indication of the accuracy of critical values obtained from first-order asymptotic theory.

AB Recent evolutionary models have introduced ''small mutation rates'' as a way of refining predictions of long-run behavior. We show that this refinement effect can only be obtained by restrictions on how the magnitude of the effect of mutation on evolution varies across states of the system. In particular, given any model of the effect of mutations, any invariant distribution of the ''mutationless'' process is close to an invariant distribution of the process with appropriately chosen small mutation rates.

AB This paper studies the effects of unions on the structure of wages, using an estimation technique that explicitly accounts for misclassification errors in reported union status, and potential correlations between union status and unobserved productivity. The econometric model is estimated separately for five skill groups using a large panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with lower levels of observed skills. In addition, the patterns of selection bias differ by skill group. Among workers with lower levels of observed skill, unionized workers are positively selected, whereas union workers are negatively selected from among those with higher levels of observed skill.

The effects of increasing payoffs for the public good and of decreasing groupsize are investigated. Attention is focused on (I) the determination of expectations; (2) the use of expectations when deciding on behaviour; (3) differences in expectations and behaviour between individuals with different value orientations.

   TRADERS; SPREAD; GAMES; ODDS
AB Empirical studies of parimutuel games establish several facts not previously explained by theory. For example, market odds fail to provide accurate predictions of outcomes (Ali, 1979; Dolbear, 1993; Goodwin, 1993) and longshots earn lower expected values than other bets (Ali, 1977; Metzger, 1985). This paper outlines a model of parimutuel games in which such outcomes arise as a consequence of the takeout of the track. Betters may purchase true probabilities of events, and equilibrium entry and wagers of these informed bettors lead to patterns observed in previous studies. A case study of the Woodlands Greyhound Park supplies evidence consistent with the model.

AB This paper explores the consequences of imperfect knowledge for exchange rate dynamics within I the monetary class of models. Our framework, which we call the theories consistent expectations (TCE) framework, provides a particular formalisation of a world in which agents use theories in order to look forward, but in which these theories provide only qualitative knowledge rather than quantitative knowledge about the economy. We find that as long as agents possess al least some degree of imperfect knowledge, the monetary models of the exchange rate generate dynamics consistent with the behaviour observed in the literature.

Unlike other models of this type, our model has predictions that are largely consistent with existing empirical findings about partisan and electoral effects on government expenditure, tax revenue, and debt. It also yields new predictions about how the feedback of fiscal policy on lagged debt may depend on partisan and electoral effects. These new predictions are not rejected by a test of the model on UK data.

AB It is contended that Pigou's scientific 'vision' in Industrial Fluctuations (1927) has much in common with that of modern business cycle theory. Both stressed, though to different degrees, the centrality of competition and rationality. However, Pigou gave much more emphasis than does modern theory to: multiplicity of causes; psychology; amplitude; interaction among impulses; non-perfect competition; labour market institutions; externalities. Thus his work may have some lessons for modern economists in terms of the scope and method of business cycle theory.

AB Numerous studies have shown that within industries, the propensity to perform R&D and the amount of R&D conducted by performers are closely related to the size of the firm, while R&D productivity declines with firm size. These findings have been widely interpreted to indicate that there is no advantage to large firm size in conducting R&D. We show how a simple model based on the idea of R&D cost spreading can explain the prior findings about the R&D-firm size relationship, as well as additional features of the R&D-firm size relationship, implying an advantage to large size in R&D.

The model is tested on data relating to a sample of firms in the UK engineering industry over the period 1983-6. The results indicate that non-adopters experience reduced profits as other firms adopt new technologies and that the gross profit gains to adopters of new technology lire related to firm and industry characterising, the number of other users of new technologies and the cost ef acquisition.

The data set used enables the relative importance of unions, firm size, profitability, ownership and firm age to be assessed on the basis of cross-section evidence. It is shown that all these factors affect earnings. A panel data based estimation of the importance of the profitability term provides strong support for a rent sharing theory of wage determination in a developing country similar to much recent evidence for developed country labour markers.

Except for the large cross-section of countries, all data sets display strong evidence of sigma-convergence and absolute beta-convergence. The cross-section of countries exhibits sigma-divergence and conditional beta-convergence. The speed of conditional convergence, which is very similar across data sets, is close to 2 % per year.

AB The empirical convergence literature envisages a world in which the presence or lack of convergence is a function of capital accumulation. This focus ignores a long tradition among economic historians and growth theorists which emphasises technology and the potential for technology transfer. We suggest here that this neglect is an important oversight: simple models which incorporate technology transfer provide a richer framework for thinking about convergence. Empirically, differences in technologies across countries and sectors appear to match differences in labour productivity and to exhibit interesting changes over time.

AB Convergence concerns poor economies catching up with rich ones. Al issue is what happens to the cross sectional distribution of economies, not whether a single economy tends towards its own steady state. It is the latter, however, that has preoccupied the traditional approach to convergence analysis. This paper describes a body of research that overcomes this shortcoming in the traditional approach. The new findings - on persistence and stratification; on the formation of convergence clubs; and on the distribution polarising into twin peaks of rich and poor - suggest the relevance of a class of theoretical ideas, different from the production-function accounting traditionally favoured.

It argues that in contrast to the prevailing wisdom, the traditional neoclassical growth paradigm generates the club convergence hypothesis as well as the conditional convergence hypothesis. Furthermore, the inclusion of empirically significant variables such as human capital, income distribution, and fertility in conventional growth models, along with capital markets imperfections, externalities, and non-convexities: strengthens the viability of club convergence as a competing hypothesis with conditional convergence.

AB We use data from an agricultural labour market in which workers receive both time- and piece-rate wages and shift frequently among employers and tasks, to assess the roles of comparative advantage, information problems and preferences in determining the allocation of workers. The estimates which impose minimal structure not implied by economic theory are consistent with a one-factor productivity model, and indicate that information asymmetries are present but workers are sorted according to comparative advantage, In particular, the disproportionate presence of female workers in weeding activities is due not to worker or employer preferences but to comparative advantage and statistical discrimination.

TI Intra-firm bargaining under non-binding contracts
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; INVESTMENTS; INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP; COSTS
AB We present a new methodology for studying the problem of intra-firm bargaining, based on the notion that contracts cannot commit the firm and its agents to wages and employment. We develop and analyse a general non-cooperative multilateral bargaining framework between the firm and its employees and consider outcomes which are immune to renegotiations by any party. Equilibrium firm profits are characterizable as both a weighted average of a neo-classical (non-bargaining) firm's profits and a generalization of Shapley value for a corresponding cooperative game. Furthermore, the resulting payoffs induce economically significant distortions in the firm's input and organizational-design decisions.

TI Redistribution and non-consumption smoothing in an open economy
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEBT
AB This paper presents a model where income distribution and redistributive fiscal policy interact to affect the budget deficit and the pattern of net borrowing of a country. According to the standard representative agent paradigm, a small open economy should smooth consumption by borrowing from (lending to) the rest of the world when its income increases (declines) over time. The simple model of this paper delivers exactly the same predictions in the absence of income dispersion. When income distribution is not degenerate, however, the same model gives rise to a surprising wealth of results. In particular, poor economies with high inequality may exhibit completely counter-intuitive patterns of fiscal policy and external borrowing. The country's production path; declines over time, because the more mobile agents leave the country to escape taxation; yet, the country might end up having a budget deficit and borrowing from abroad, thereby reinforcing rather than smoothing the asymmetry in consumption between the two periods. An important feature of this outcome is that it is backed by both the poor and the rich, who gain from the fiscal system at the expense of the middle class.

ID CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX; TIME-SERIES REGRESSION; HETEROSKEDASTICITY
AB Many unit root tests have distorted sizes when the root of the error process is close to the unit circle. This paper analyses the properties of the Phillips-Perron tests and some of their variants in the problematic parameter space. We use local asymptotic analyses to explain why the Phillips-Perron tests suffer from severe size distortions regardless of the choice of the spectral density estimator but that the modified statistics show dramatic improvements in size when used in conjunction with a particular formulation of an autoregressive spectral density estimator. We explain why kernel based spectral density estimators aggravate the size problem in the Phillips-Perron tests and yield no size improvement to the modified statistics. The local asymptotic power of the modified statistics are also evaluated. These modified statistics are recommended as being useful in empirical work since they are free of the size problems which have plagued many unit root tests, and they retain respectable power.

ID OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS MODELS; COMPETITIVE-EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET;

AB Do the implications for business cycle issues change when we switch from studying infinitely-lived, representative-agent models to more sophisticated demographic structures with finitely lived agents? This article addresses that question by using a large, overlapping-generations model that is calibrated to U.S. demographic properties, microeconomic evidence, and National Income and Product Accounts. The finding is that the answers obtained are basically the same for the two kinds of models. The article also explores the relative volatility of hours across age groups, an issue that cannot be addressed by using the infinitely-lived, representative-agent abstraction.

TI Cooperation in community interaction without information flows
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; REPEATED GAMES; EQUILIBRIA
AB We study cooperative behaviour in communities where the flow of information regarding past conduct is limited or missing. Players are initially randomly matched with no knowledge of each other's past actions; they endogenously decide whether or not to continue the repeated relationship. There is incomplete information regarding player types: a subset of the population is myopic, while the remainder have discount factors that permit cooperation, in principle. We define social equilibrium in such communities. Such equilibria are characterized by an initial testing phase, followed by cooperation if the test is successful. It is precisely the presence of myopic types that permit cooperation, by raising barriers to entry into new relationships. We examine the implications of increased patience, which takes two forms: an increase in the number of non-myopic types, and an increase in the discount factor of non-myopic types. These two notions turn out to have strikingly different implications for the degree of cooperation that can be sustained.

AB This paper describes an organizational setting in which professional employees are required to work inefficiently long hours. The focus of our investigation is large law firms. The income sharing that characterizes legal partnerships creates incentives to promote associates who have a propensity to work very hard. Law firms use indicators of this propensity-especially an associate's record of billable hours-in promotion decisions. Reliance upon work hours as an indicator lends to a ''rat-race'' equilibrium in which associates work too many hours. We find evidence in support of this conclusion with data we collected from two large law firms.

ID SIGNALING GAMES; GOODS; COMPETITION; QUALITY; PRICE
AB We examine conditions under which ''Veblen effects'' arise from the desire to achieve social status by signaling wealth through conspicuous consumption. While Veblen effects cannot ordinarily arise when preferences satisfy a ''single-crossing property,'' they may emerge when this property fails. In that case, ''budget'' brands are priced at marginal cost, while ''luxury'' brands, though not intrinsically superior, are sold at higher prices to consumers seeking to advertise wealth. Luxury brands earn strictly positive profits under conditions that would, with standard formulations of preferences, yield marginal-cost pricing. We explore factors that induce Veblen effects, and we investigate policy implications.

AB This paper examines a novel mechanism linking fertility and growth. There are three components to the model: first, increases in capital per worker raise women's relative wages, since capital is more complementary to women's labor input than to men's. Second, increasing women's relative wages reduces fertility by raising the cost of children more than household income. And third, lower fertility mises the level of capital per worker. This positive feedback loop generates a demographic transition. a rapid decline in fertility accompanied by accelerated output growth.

We calculate the empirical drilling hazard function for cohorts in specific areas. For each year of the lease, we study the determinants of the decision whether to begin exploratory drilling and their relationship to the outcome of any drilling activity. Our results indicate that equilibrium predictions of plausible noncooperative models are reasonably accurate and more descriptive than those of cooperative models of drilling timing. We discuss why noncooperative behavior may occur and the potential gains from coordination.

We demonstrate the existence of a swing voter's curse: less informed indifferent voters strictly prefer to abstain rather than vote for either candidate even when voting is costless. The swing voter's curse leads to the equilibrium result that a substantial fraction of the electorate will abstain even though all abstainers strictly prefer voting for one candidate over voting for another.

English auctions mise more revenue than first-price auctions only when bidders do not suffer from a strong winner's curse. Agents employ other bidders' drop-out prices along with their private information as Nash bidding theory predicts. However, a simple and natural signal-averaging rule, that does not require recognizing the adverse-selection effect of winning the auction, better characterizes the data than the Nash rule. Monte Carlo simulations using FIML estimates of the signal-averaging rule predict a number of data characteristics not directly employed in the estimation procedure.

We postulate that the parties can sign noncontingent contracts prior to investing, and can freely renegotiate them after information about the desirability of trade is revealed. We find that such contracts can induce one party to invest efficiently when courts impose either a breach remedy of specific performance or expectation damages. Moreover, specific performance can induce both parties to invest efficiently if a separability condition holds. Expectation damages, on the other hand, is poorly suited to solve bilateral investment problems.

AB Why are some firms purchased by their employees? The paper explores this question theoretically, suggesting that employees may attempt to overcome their informational handicap regarding firm profitability by making simultaneous offers on wages and a purchase price for the firm. Owners of relatively unprofitable firms will tend to sell out for low prices instead of paying high wages, whereas owners of profitable firms will prefer to pay high wages over receiving low firm prices; the buyout serves as a screening mechanism. The probability of an employee buyout decreases with the employees' outside options and increases with owners' outside options.

These conditions impose weaker and more empirically plausible restrictions on price movements than the currently existing alternative to separability, the Hicks-Leontief-composite commodity theorem. The idea is to allow departures from Hicks-Leontief that take the form of well behaved error terms. Utility functions that permit generalized composite commodity aggregation include the AIDS model, the translog, all homothetic utility functions, and any utility function when demands are aggregated to two groups of goods. Implications of empirical nonstationarity of relative prices for aggregation and demand estimation are considered.

AB A voluntary export restraint (VER) is preferred to a tariff by a government concerned about electoral returns when the influence of industry profits is large relative to the losses to consumers from higher prices. If the foreign firm is uncertain of these pressures, the antidumping (AD) code facilitates the complete transfer of the relevant information and generates a VER rather than a tariff in equilibrium.

Domestic and foreign profits rise with the AD-generated VER, and the VER lowers the volume of trade by more than the expected duty.

AB Regularities concerning how entry, exit, market structure, and innovation vary from the birth of technologically progressive industries through maturity are summarized. A model emphasizing differences in firm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm size in appropriating the returns from innovation is developed to explain the regularities. The model also explains regularities regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort innovative productivity, cost, and profitability. It predicts that over time firms devote more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of product innovation eventually wither.

   community structure and school finance
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; EQUILIBRIUM; CONVERGENCE; INEQUALITY
AB This paper examines how socioeconomic stratification and alternative systems of education finance affect inequality and growth. Agents interact through local public goods or externalities (school funding, neighborhood effects) and economy-wide linkages (complementary skills, knowledge spillovers). Sorting families into homogeneous communities often minimizes the costs of existing heterogeneity, but mixing reduces heterogeneity faster. Integration therefore tends to slow down growth in the short run yet raise it in the long run. A move to state funding of education presents society with a similar intertemporal trade-off. Local and global complementarities play major roles in determining the efficient social and educational structures.

ID EQUITY PREMIUM; EQUILIBRIUM; CONSUMPTION; COSTS; EARNINGS; AVERSION;
   RETURNS; PUZZLE; MODEL
AB We examine an economy in which agents cannot write contracts contingent on future labor income. The agents face aggregate uncertainty in the form of dividend and systematic labor income risk, and also idiosyncratic labor income risk, which is calibrated using the PSID. The agents trade in financial securities to buffer their idiosyncratic income shocks, but the extent of trade is limited by borrowing constraints, short-sales constraints, and transactions costs. By simultaneously considering aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, we decompose the effect of transactions costs on the equity premium into two components. The direct effect occurs because individuals equate the net-of-cost margins. A second, indirect effect occurs because transactions costs result in individual consumption that more closely tracks individual income. In the simulations we find that the direct effect dominates rand that the model can produce a sizable equity premium only if transactions costs are large or the assumed quantity of tradable assets is limited.

AB Using annual data spanning two centuries for dollar-sterling and franc-sterling real exchange rates, we find strong evidence of mean-reverting real exchange rate behavior. Using simple, stationary, autoregressive models estimated on prefloat data, we easily outperform nonstationary real exchange rate models in dynamic forecasting exercises over the recent float. Such stationary univariate equations explain 60-80 percent of the in-sample variation in real exchange rates, although the degree of short-run persistence may be high. The econometric estimates imply a half-life of shocks to the real exchange rate of about 6 years for dollar-sterling and a little under 3 years for franc-sterling.

AB This paper studies the behavior of the exchange rate in the Kareken-Wallace overlapping generations economy with two currencies in which decision rules are updated using the genetic algorithm. The analysis shows that a stationary monetary equilibrium of the Kareken-Wallace model is not stable under the genetic algorithm dynamics. The fluctuations in the genetic algorithm exchange rate are driven by fluctuations in the portfolio fractions, which change over time in response to the inequality between the rates of return on two currencies. Further, both the genetic algorithm simulations and the experiments with human subjects were characterized by continuing fluctuations of the exchange rate, with first-period consumption values close to a stationary value.

AB We show that discrimination can occur even when it is common knowledge that underlying group characteristics do not differ and when employers do not prefer same-group candidates. When employers can judge job applicants' unknown qualities better when candidates belong to the same group and hire the best prospect from a large pool of applicants, the top applicant is likely to have the same background as the employer. The model has policy, empirical, and experimental implications. For example, the model predicts that ''screening discrimination'' is more likely to occur and persist in sectors in which underlying quality is important but difficult to observe, there are numerous applicants, interviewing (screening) is relatively cheap, and applicants have to acquire job-specific skills.

AB This paper documents the variation in dealer discounts for new cars using transactions price data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Consumer-specific characteristics fail to explain dealer discounts, whereas model, market-specific, and purchase transaction variables (e.g., first-time purchase, trade-in, and financing through dealer) do explain them. The results contradict earlier findings of race and gender discrimination based on a controlled experiment. This contradiction is reconciled by examining the higher moments of the empirical discount distribution; while mean and median markups do not vary by race and gender, minority purchases are characterized by higher dispersion. This may rationalize the disparate treatment of minorities by dealers documented in the controlled experiment.
