The paper thereby helps explain why such nominal nonstationarities are widely observed. Further implications are drawn for base drift, distribution of real returns on long-term, fixed-rate nominal debt, and operating characteristics of interest-rate pegs and policy instruments."

In particular, it is shown that the bequest motive is always too weak, and public debt therefore nonneutral, when nonphysical assets have a well-defined function (reducing oversavings) in the corresponding economy without bequest motive, i.e., when the nonaltruistic economy is dynamically inefficient."

This paper derives the combination of monetary and lump-sum fiscal policy which maximizes the sum of discounted utilities of representative consumers in present and future generations. Under the optimal policy package, the steady state has a zero nominal interest rate and has monetary contraction at the rate of intergenerational discount. As the intergenerational discount rate approaches zero, optimal policy maximizes steady-state utility of the representative consumer. In this case, the optimal steady state is characterized by a constant nominal money supply."

Further, monetary injection is not unique in converting inefficiency to efficiency. The same conversion is possible in markets for consumption loans. The common factor of both conversions is redistribution of wealth prior to trade. Such redistributions correspond to redistributions of numeraire in complete, timeless markets."

The specific implication tested is whether output responses to nominal disturbances (industry Phillips Curve slopes) are inversely related to wage-indexation elasticities. The Phillips Curve slopes are found to vary across industries for the Canadian economy, but bear no relationship to indexation elasticities, casting doubt on the role of nominal-wage rigidity in generating the observed non-neutrality of money."

These results arise even though the author examines the same model used by Barro, where temporary substitution of debt for lump-sum taxes was shown to have no real effects. He shows that these anti-Keynesian effects on consumption are as significant as various pro-Keynesian effects, such as finite lives.

208,"AB: This paper studies the consequences of allowing information acquisition in a version of the Lucas-Barro incomplete information model of the business cycle. The author applies the information equilibrium concept to show that an agent's information acquisition is not invariant to fluctuations of the price level and that it has a significant effect on the size of the output-inflation tradeoff. Using the optimality criteria developed by Muench, he finds that a change in the mean money growth rate does not have any real consequences and that a constant money-growth rule is superior to any monetary policy that induces all of the agents to be fully informed."

More importantly, the authors find a negative and significant relation between the returns to winning bidders and the number of bidders participating in the auction.

Hercowitz is used to derive a neutrality proposition for anticipated movements in the aggregate price level and to demonstrate its equivalence econometrically to the exogeneity of relative prices with respect to the aggregate price level. Multivariate causality tests provide a basis for testing these restrictions. The empirical results provide mixed evidence for the equilibrium models, while the variation in the findings across industries suggests a role for supply-side disturbances in explaining comovements in aggregate and relative prices."

This paper attributes this apparent change in the Fisher relation to differences in the stochastic process of inflation, rather than a change in any structural relationship between interest rates and expected inflation.

The economic impact of this policy seems unlikely to have come through the conventional Keynesian channels of a shortage of liquidity and high ex ante real interest rates, but instead may have operated through unanticipated deflation and, after 1930, through the disruption of financial intermediation as a consequence of the banking panics."

This result has important implications for pricing options and for analyzing the predictive properties of forward rates. The authors show that the stochastic process structure leads to a downward revision in estimates of forward rate predictive power.

The combination of reserve requirements and inflation results in a lower steady-state utility than a direct tax on deposits. The optimal monetary policy when reserves are required is to minimize reserve requirements and inflate without limit the stock of fiat money."

A large, open-economy, intertemporal framework, in which Ricardian equivalence holds, predicts a larger effect of temporary government spending changes on the trade deficit than permanent ones. Further, a pure switch between debt and taxes should have no effect on trade flows. The results provide some support for these hypotheses, already they are sensitive to sample period and the method of decomposition of government spending. A negative relationship between government spending and the terms of trade is also found."

Temporary increases, which appeared mainly during wars, raised long-term interest rates, but significantly increased the growth rates of money and prices only during suspensions of the gold standard (1797-1821 and 1914-18). Temporary changes in military spending accounted for the bulk of budget deficits. The author found only two major non-war deficits-one associated with compensation payments to slaveowners in 1835-36 and the other with a dispute over the income tax in 1909-10. Interest rates did not react much to these deficits."

This topic has remained controversial because most of the natural experiments provided by history have provided inadequate data for testing the competing theories. This paper analyzes an exceptionally good natural experiment recently provided by Canada and the United States. After moving together for many years, American and Canadian private saving rates have sharply diverged over the last decade. The primary conclusion emerging from our analysis is that tax policies can have a potent impact on private saving behavior."

Recent deficits have coincided with reduced national saving and a substantial increase in the share of GNP devoted to consumption."

The presence of intergenerational effects enlarges, for a given fiscal policy, the set of admissible monetary policies and weakens the need to monetize the deficit. Comparisons between the growth and interest rates are in general insufficient to predict whether increased deficit must be monetized because of existence of both bond and money seigniorage Laffer curves."

The major result is that conditional on this operating procedure, secrecy can reduce the variability of the federal funds rate.

54,AB: This paper examines the official Commerce Department estimates of gross national product for 1909-28 and suggests that they are far inferior to the less commonly used Kendrick GNP estimates. The paper then derives a revised version of the Kendrick series that alters significantly the representation of annual movements in GNP before 1919. This endorsement of a revised Kendrick GNP series in place of the official Commerce Department estimates before 1929 suggests that aggregate demand movements had much less effect on real output during World War I and the Depression of 1921 than is commonly believed.

70,"AB: In ""The Equity Risk Premium: A Puzzle,"" Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott (1985) developed an Arrow-Debreu asset pricing model. They rejected it because it could not explain high enough equity risk premia. They concluded that only non-Arrow-Debreu models would solve this ""puzzle."" Here, the author respecifies their model, capturing the effects of possible, though unlikely, market crashes. While maintaining their model's attractive features, this allows it to explain high equity risk premia and low risk-free returns. It does so with reasonable degrees of time preference and risk aversion, provided the crashes are plausibly severe and not too improbable."

In the model used, money has the property of reducing transactions costs. A sufficient condition for a tax on money to be welfare-dominated by a linear tax on consumption expenditures is characterized in terms of a few parameters, very familiar in macroeconomics. This characterization is especially useful in the cases of heterogeneous consumers and increasing returns to scale in transactions, since then the optimal tax on money may in principle be positive."

Preferences and production possibilities are restricted so that the economy displays steady-state growth. The authors explore the implications of the basic model for capital accumulation and for economic fluctuations initiated by impulses to technology. They argue that the neoclassical approach will enhance the understanding of fluctuations. Nevertheless, an important shortcoming of the model is that substantial persistence in technology shocks is required if the model is to exhibit periods of economic activity that persistently deviate from a smooth growth path."

After presenting evidence that both nominal and real expected speculative profits are non-zero, the paper examines if real returns to forward speculation are consistent with consumption-based models of risk premia. Estimates of the conditional covariance between real speculative returns and real consumption growth are presented and, like ex ante returns to forward speculation, they exhibit statistically significant fluctuations over time and often change sign."

Are the variances, covariances, and parameters in the model such as to favor one instrument over the other, in particular the interest rate over the money supply? Results for the regular version of the model provide support for what seems to be the Fed's current choice of using the interest rate as its primary instrument. On the other hand, the results support the use of the money supply as the primary instrument if there are rational expectations in the bond market."

The model considered here demonstrates that reducing central bank secrecy can actually reduce the forecasting accuracy of many of the private agents in the economy when it is recognized that some agents engage in ""Fed watching"" and others do not. This result comes about because the interest rate process depends in part on the information that agents use in forecasting future interest rates."

However, substantial variation in gross national product growth remains unexplained by the real factors that the authors consider."

The saving decisions of consumers take account of the fact that conditional risk is a serially-correlated random variable. By restricting the specification of consumers' preferences and the stochastic specification of dividends, it is possible to obtain an exact solution for the prices of the aggregate stock and riskless one-period bonds. An increase in the conditional risk reduces the stock price if, and only if, the elasticity of marginal utility is less than one."

Like secured debt, off balance sheet activities permit banks to sell a portion of the cash flows associated with new investment opportunities. This ability permits banks to invest in loans with positive net present values that they would pass up if restricted to deposit financing. An examination of rates on large certificates of deposit provides evidence consistent with the model."

In a monetary economy, they show that in equilibrium the unemployed are worse off if high inflation implies high unemployment.

Free bank notes were demanded because they were priced to reflect the expected value of their backing. The empirical evidence supports this explanation. Specifically, in New York, Wisconsin, and Indiana the expected value of backing was sufficient for free bank notes to circulate at par, which they did. In Minnesota, the backing for notes was very poor: they exchanged well below par, being treated as small-denomination securities."

711,"AB: The authors analyze the impact of current FDIC deposit insurance practices on banks' pricing of risk. They show that FDIC insurance tends to subsidize risky loans and that the subsidy increases with risk. The authors also show that the FDIC subsidy increases if contractually uninsured deposits are insured implicitly. Furthermore, implicit insurance has the perverse effect of biasing the subsidy towards loans that represent systemic risk to the banking system. This analysis can explain both banks' apparent overexposure to LDCs and their underpricing of these loans prior to the debt crisis."

With distortionary taxes, nominal debt provides valuable insurance against the budgetary effects of economic fluctuations. He shows that a welfare-maximizing government always issues some nominal debt even though nominal debt increases inflation along the time-consistent path of the economy. The result is fairly robust with respect to changes in assumptions about policy constraints and about the macroeconomic setting."

The authors find that changes in the target caused large movements in short-term rates and smaller, but significant, movements in intermediate- and long-term rates. They hypothesize that the similarity of the reactions of three-, six-, and twelve-month rates to changes in the target offers a possible explanation for the lack of support for the expectations theory from studies that have tested the theory using these rates."

The previous negative results appear to be due to the use of data biased against the hypothesis--the shipments and inventory data of the Department of Commerce. This paper also shows that sensible results can be obtained from estimating approximations to decision equations as opposed to estimating Euler equations."

They show that the model can account for neither the sign nor the magnitude of average risk premiums in forward prices and holding-period returns. The economy is also incapable of generating enough variation in risk premiums to account for rejections of the expectations hypothesis with Treasury bill data. These conclusions add to the growing list of empirical deficiencies of the representative agent model of asset pricing.

An additional puzzle--the risk-free rate puzzle--emerges instead: why is the risk-free rate so low if agents are so averse to intertemporal substitution?"

Under the assumption that the variance of the error correction term is constant, the data evidence is found to reject super exogeneity."

The moving average component of the commitment policy is of higher order than the discretionary policy.

224,"AB: This paper demonstrates that a change in parameters of the money market that is not immediately understood will affect the behavior of exchange-rate forecast errors while the market is learning. The analysis is applied to the behavior of U.S. dollar-German mark forecast errors during the early 1980s when the market appeared to systematically underpredict the strength of the dollar. Consistent with this observation, empirical estimates of implied forecast errors, based upon Bayesian learning, suggest that forecast errors would have been on-average negative during the period as the market came to realize the increase in U.S. money demand."

In contrast to R. Jones's (1976) seminal article in which individuals are restricted to fix trading strategies before entering the market, the present model assumes that individuals have conditional trading strategies that allow them to effect exchange according to the types of trades they encounter in the market. The analysis shows how decentralized market forces generate money and lead to a unique level of monetization."

This defines a pair of payoff matrices, and the second stage involves determining the Nash equilibrium for this bimatrix game. In the authors' illustrative example, for the alternative shocks considered, a dominant Nash equilibrium is always obtained."

The consumer optimization problem under resale market imperfection is formulated and solved numerically by dynamic programming algorithm. The obtained decision rules of consumers reveal the slow upward and downward adjustments of durables stock. The simulated aggregate durables expenditures with resale market imperfection exhibit substantial serial correlations similar to those found in actual durables expenditures time series. The substantial serial correlations are found to be related to the pattern of the decision rules under resale market imperfections.

This paper shows that, in general equilibrium, an increase in exogenous risk usually increases expected output in that technology (the results from the theory of the firm), but it may also increase risk of that technology (the results from finance). An increase in exogenous risk always reallocates capital toward less risky businesses."

Other interventions require changes in monetary and fiscal policy, their effects depend, generally, on the influence of these changes on the economy and not on the intervention alone.

Estimated moments of the distribution of returns over five-minute intervals often exhibit large changes that are mostly unpredictable even from one day to the next. Autocorrelation in returns is generally absent even inside a given day. Specific days of the week do not exhibit any special characteristics. During a single day, both relative changes in exchage rates, as well as their volatility, show some distinct patterns."

In addition, it addresses the question of whether money serves to complete markets in these models. The author shows that money does not complete markets in the sense of expanding the set of state-contingent commodities that an individual may trade. The introduction of money effects state-contingent transfers of wealth between individuals, this is a generalization of a result obtained by J. Marshall, J. Sonstelie, and C. Gilles (1987). Numerical simulation of the model suggests that the risk sharing induced in the monetary economy leads to substantial increases in welfare levels relative to the nonmonetary economy."

This paper focuses on one explanation of this relationship, a nominal tax approach. According to this theory, in countries with specific nominal tax components to their tax systems, inflation increases the effective tax rate, thereby lowering after-tax returns. Analyzing monthly data for West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States for the period 1960-81, and annual data for the United Kingdom and the United States for the period 1870-1980, the author finds little empirical support for the nominal tax approach."

It is well known that fixed-premium deposit insurance leads a bank to prefer a high-variance asset portfolio, but its effect on individual asset choice has not been carefully evaluated. This paper demonstrates how bank examination procedures and capital adequacy standards can make the value of a bank's deposit insurance contract concave in individual asset risks. Insured bankers may therefore have a rational preference (ceteris paribus) for relatively safe individual loans, even while they prefer risky portfolio returns. The model's implications for loan securitization and the federal regulators' new risk-based capital standards are discussed."

23,"AB: This paper develops a model of endogenous idiosyncratic risk in a simple two-period general equilibrium setting and examines its implications for the behavior of asset returns. The model readily generates empirically plausible idiosyncratic risk in consumption and yields more realistic behavior of asset returns than comparable models with perfect insurance. The most dramatic effects of imperfect risk-sharing, however, are not on the spreads between asset returns, but on their absolute levels. Overall, the results suggest allowing for incomplete markets can contribute to a resolution of the equity premium puzzle."

Since the preferences studied need not be time-additive, they allow the marginal utility of consumption on a given date to vary with consumption on other dates. Intertemporal dependence is induced by the presence of a variable individual rate of time preference. The optimal consumption responses to transitory and anticipated changes in incomes and interest rates are easily derived and are similar in many respects to the responses implied by the standard, constant time-preference model. Intuitive explanations of the first-order conditions describing optimal paths are provided."

79,AB: Researchers characterizing optimal tax policies for dynamic economies have reasoned that tax rates should follow a random walk. The authors conduct a frequency-domain examination of U.S. tax rates and reject the hypothesis that the first difference in the series is white noise. The source of the rejection is pronounced activity of tax changes at an eight-year cycle. Regression analysis confirms the finding that there is a cyclical component to tax changes corresponding to changes in political party administration. The results suggest that the positive theory of government finance needs to be refined to incorporate features of political equilibrium.

Changes in reserve requirements do not influence yields on Treasury securities or returns on broad-based portfolios of nonfinancial stocks and, thus, do not impound new information about monetary policy. Moreover, changes in reserve requirements have an impact on nonbank financial firms that is opposite in sign to that of banks. This suggests that reserve requirements shift the locus of some financial activities from the banking sector to the nonbank sector of the financial system."

Several theoretical studies find that when borrowers have private information about risk, the lowest-risk borrowers tend to pledge collateral. In contrast, conventional wisdom holds that when risk is observable, the highest-risk borrowers tend to pledge collateral. An additional issue is whether secured loans (as opposed to secured borrowers) tend to be safer or riskier than unsecured loans. Empirical evidence presented here strongly suggests that collateral is most often associated with riskier borrowers, riskier loans, and riskier banks."

Existing contributions are divided into two classes: the larger one consists of models with a unique perfect-foresight equilibrium, while the second includes models where equilibrium is indeterminate and the set of equilibria involving endogenous fluctuations includes ""sunspots equilibria."" While the two classes of models involve oscillations of different natures and with different policy implications, they show that both are consistent with optimizing behavior and competitive equilibrium."

There are, however, inconsistencies between the Hall-Flavin version of the permanent income hypothesis and pure time-series representations of the permanent income hypothesis based upon Milton A.

This paper considers the force of the recent challenges to the permanent income hypothesis when the implications of the permanent income hypothesis are drawn from a Friedman-Muth version of the permanent income hypothesis, rather than the Hall-Flavin version."

Further, it shows that in this economy, assuming that the large sample properties of generalized method of moments estimators are true in small samples can lead one to ""overreject"" the model. It suggests that tests proposed by L. Hansen and R. Jagannathan (1989) may avoid these difficulties."

Shocks to underlying returns to risky projects are magnified and prolonged by the learning process. Multiple equilibria may exist and the magnification effect may be even larger since shocks can move the credit market to a new equilibrium. The allocation of credit is generally not a constrained Pareto-efficient allocation."

However, a financial institution--perhaps best viewed as a savings bank--can provide partial insurance by generating a time pattern of deposit returns that redistributes wealth from agents with high incomes to those with low incomes, resulting in a level of expected utility higher than that achievable in simple security markets. Insurance is incomplete because the bank faces a tradeoff between provision of insurance and maintenance of private incentives."

He finds significant cross-sectional differences in the sensitivity of bank stocks to changes in the price of LDC loans. Differences in sensitivity appear to be related to changes in bank exposure to LDCs. He also finds evidence consistent with the hypothesis that CDs are implicitly insured.

688,"AB: Nearly all existing studies of international coordination of fiscal deficits focus on aggregate demand aspects of the problem. In contrast, this paper adopts a dynamic general equilibrium perspective and emphasizes the public finance side of fiscal deficits. In a world with international capital mobility, the fiscal deficit of any single government affects world interest rates and, therefore, influences intertemporal resource allocation in all countries. The paper shows that these international externalities may result in inefficiently large fiscal deficits, high interest rates, and low levels of welfare if international policy coordination is absent."

702,"AB: The sectoral shifts hypothesis, advanced by David Lilien (1982) and Steve Davis (1987), suggests that unemployment is, in part, the result of resources being reallocated from declining to expanding sectors of the economy. Using U.S. data from 1931 to 1987, the authors test this hypothesis by constructing an index measuring the dispersion among stock prices from different industries. They find that lagged values of this index significantly affect unemployment. The authors show that the stock market dispersion index is less contaminated by aggregate demand influences than Lilien's employment dispersion index, which makes their test less vulnerable to the Abraham and Katz (1986) critique."

Quantitatively, however, the difference turns out to be very small. The paper shows how to calculate the optimal monetary policy as a function of the state variables using the method of parameterized expectations. In terms of expected utility, the optimal policy is as good as the simple policy that reduces the money supply at the rate of time preference."

Observational equivalence between cash-in-advance and barter models is shown under specific assumptions about the timing of information and decisions. The findings suggest that only for one cash-in-advance model are monetary effects both important for and permit improved explanation of asset returns. Success in this regard is (not) for stock (treasury-bill) returns."

The author develops an alternative method of identifying rational-expectations models within the structural vector autoregression framework that circumvents the need of imposing stringent identifying restrictions on the dynamic processes for technologies, preferences, and other mechanisms (e.g., adjustment costs). These strong restrictions may explain why rational-expectations models are frequently rejected by the data. Two empirical examples demonstrate the feasibility and potential advantages of this alternative modeling strategy."

In contrast to previous studies, the empirical analysis uses error-correction models in a way that the intertemporal budget constraint is imposed in the estimation stage."

Patinkin's conjecture that examples of Merton multiples in scientific discoveries are rare. L. Currie's money-supply series and description of Federal Reserve policymaking, emphasizing its ""real bills"" orientation, clearly anticipates later work. His money-supply mechanism, however, is significantly different from Friedman and Schwartz's because he has a severe depression generating surplus, redundant bank reserves."

137,AB: This paper evaluates the social gains from international risk sharing in some simple general-equilibrium models with output uncertainty. A simulation model calibrated to selected moments of U.S. and Japanese data estimates the incremental loss from a ban on international portfolio diversification to be on the order of 0.20 percent of output per year. Even the theoretical gains from asset trade may disappear under alternative sets of assumptions on preferences and technology. The paper argues that the small magnitude of potential trade gains may help explain the apparently inconsistent findings of empirical studies on the degree of international capital mobility.

Most inefficiencies are operational in nature, involving the overuse of physical inputs, rather than financial, involving overpayment of interest. Also, technical inefficiencies (proportionate overuse of all inputs) dominate allocative inefficiencies (improper mix of inputs). These results suggest that competitive pressures in banking from deregulation will be focused primarily on banks that do not control costs, rather than on those of a particular size or product mix."

285,AB: Several recent studies have rejected the permanent-income hypothesis using aggregate time-series data. One explanation for this rejection is that some households are liquidity-constrained. This study directly tests for liquidity constraints using panel data on individual households. It finds no evidence of liquidity constraints and suggests that the failure of the permanent-income hypothesis in aggregate data may be due to aggregation bias. The paper also contains an extended discussion of econometric methods for panel-data rational expectations models.

Schemes for financing deficits and, therefore, the existence and uniqueness of equilibria depend on two policy parameters. The model is used to (1) characterize the equilibria implied by various financing schemes, (2) derive policies where fiscal behavior determines how monetary shocks affect prices, and (3) reinterpret M. Friedman's 1948 policy framework. The paper reconsiders the result that prices are indeterminate when the nominal interest rate is pegged.

When this prior is relaxed, trend-stationarity is generally supported, thus, the unit root inference seems inappropriate for these series: despite Nelson and Plosser's results indicating that macroeconomic time series are not inconsistent with the random walk hypothesis, their results indicate that for most series the trend-stationarity hypothesis is much more likely."

567,"AB: The authors view Sowell's comments as threefold: (1) their priors were not exhaustive, (2) their procedure does not deliver Classically standard ""size"" in repeated samples, and (3) they did not place prior point mass on the unit root. In response, they note that (1) their priors were general enough to permit researchers with disparate views to draw their own inferences, (2) adopting a prior size adjustment does little to change their inferences, and (3) assigning point mass to the unit root indicates clearly that strong priors are necessary to sustain this inference. They conclude that for many macroeconomic time series, the trend-stationarity inference is quite robust."

584,AB: Bank failures are contagious due to the lack of bank-specific information. Depositors who lack financial information on individual banks make withdrawal decisions based on the condition of the banking system as a whole. A high ratio of bank failures then signals an adverse condition within the banking sector and triggers systemwide bank runs. This paper looks at bank panics in U.S. history and shows the importance of solvency information specific to individual banks. The major empirical finding is that the government or banks stopped bank panics mainly by providing financial information on banks.

A new monthly data set derived from financial publications and Second Bank records of the time is employed to investigate whether the bank operated in the public interest, as argued by its supporters, or to further its own monopolistic interests, as argued by its detractors. The paper analyzes the role played by this early central bank and provides an intriguing example of one experiment in the private provision of public goods."

644,"AB: Empirical studies of the restrictions implied by the intertemporal capital asset pricing model across different asset markets have found conflicting evidence. This paper asks whether an auxiliary assumption implicit in these tests could be responsible for the pattern of rejections. This auxiliary assumption requires that covariances of returns with consumption move in constant proportion over time. The paper tests this condition empirically using data on foreign exchange, bonds, and equity returns. Interestingly, the evidence suggests that the tendency to reject the intertemporal consumption-based asset pricing relationship depends upon the inadequacy of the auxiliary assumption, not necessarily the relationship itself."

The author obtains significant stickiness with very small menu costs. With exchange-rate variance of 10 percent p.a., the exchange rate can fluctuate 25 percent without the firm having to adjust prices. An optimal control problem is solved whereby the firm allows marginal revenue to oscillate between two boundaries. It only regulates, by changing prices, at those boundaries."

One goal is to determine the extent to which the introduction of energy price shocks reduces the reliance of the real business cycle model on unobserved technology shocks. The other goal is to compare the correlation between real wages and hours predicted by the energy-inclusive model to that predicted by Hansen's model.

This test is applied to postwar U.S. quarterly real GNP. The test concludes that GNP is consistent with both models. The estimated fractional parameter is significantly smaller than reported in Kiebold and Rudebusch (1989). The difference is explained by bias in the previous estimates.

Targeting the asset prices is tantamount to targeting the real interest rate: when all of the weight in the reaction function is placed on asset prices, the real rate converges so rapidly that policy loses control of inflation."

Real stock prices drop when long-term interest rates rise (and rise when they fall) more than would be implied by this vector autoregression model. In contrast, over the last century changes in real stock prices have shown little correlation with changes in inflation rates, and according to the present value model they should show little correlation. These conclusions were reached from an analysis of annual data in the United States, 1871-1989, and the United Kingdom, 1918-89."

This paper shows, however, that nonconvergence is an artifact of the deterministic structure of endogenous growth models: when stochastic factor productivity is introduced, convergence tends to occur despite nondiminishing returns to capital and persistent growth. For the case of constant returns to capital, it is shown that output paths of different economies converge with probability one in single-sector economies. For multisectoral economies, convergence occurs for most plausible specifications of the stochastic process driving productivity. Increasing returns reduce the probability of convergence."

It displays a general equilibrium, multigood model with spatial separation for which steady state equilibria exist in which both cash (i.e., fiat currency) and trade credit are used in exchange. Transaction costs, restrictions on the timing of trade, and a positive nominal interest rate cause the laissez-faire equilibrium to be nonoptimal. A quantitative restriction on the use of trade credit can yield a Pareto-superior allocation."

Overall, when activities are sufficiently complementary and inventory holding is sufficiently costly, nonconvexities at the firm level can generate a pattern of output and sales such that the variance of output exceeds that of sales at an aggregate level. In this way, nonconvexities at the individual firm level may have macroeconomic consequences."

The model they employ includes overlapping generations, fiat currency, and a risky physical asset. Its implications depend critically on whether it is specified so as to be ""diversifying""--so that fiat currency has value when the expenditure is financed via optimal taxation of asset returns. If the specification is diversifying, RRS is broadly equivalent to SD, and an interior reserve ratio can be part of an optimal financing scheme. If it is not, the best RRS scheme involves an extreme reserve ratio, produces a hyperinflation, and is Pareto-dominated by a pure deposit tax scheme."

454,"AB: Although the permanent-income model is a cornerstone of macroeconomics, the evidence for its assumption that output has a transitory component is mixed. This paper documents transitory variation in GNP. The story centers on the variation in investment, relative to consumption. Consumption behaves like a random walk. In the long term, investment moves one-for-one with consumption. In the near term, however, investment takes strong transitory swings away f rom the random walk it shares with consumption. These surges in investme nt, relative to consumption, are not offset by government expenditures. Transitory variation in investment, thus, becomes transitory variation in GNP."

These effects are modeled with a monetary production economy in which central bank injections of cash are funneled into the economy through the credit market. Since only borrowers have direct access to the newly injected cash, monetary injections cause nominal interest rates to fall. If firms are borrowers, then monetary injections also increase current and future real activity."

They also use their model to isolate the seasonal movements in U.S. quarterly data and then compute the seasonal variations in tastes and technology that approximately explain these movements. The authors find comovements in productivity and taste perturbations that are very similar to the seasonal comovements of aggregate variables.

This interpretation provides welfare justification for imposing quantity limits on the bank money stock. The authors argue that the monetary regime established in England under Peel's Act imposed such a quantity limit. Their findings support quantity theorists' traditional view that the possibility of ""overissue"" provides a rationale for bank regulation."

The author suggests that textual interpretation in economics should not consider motives because better methods are available and are now used. He proposes three standards.

The correlations change substantially in each case. The authors conclude that the traditional analysis and modern models, which rely completely on demand-side behavior, cannot explain the observed correlations.

That is, while the model is able to account for the observed stability of the seigniorage-GNP ratio, a Cagan-type model is able to account for the observed stability of the seigniorage-GNP ratio, a Cagan-type model predicts a Laffer curve for seigniorage.

In stationary economies, Pareto-improving transfers require institutions cost as much to construct as they convey--even if less costly institutions exist that make the same transfer. If institutions can be built upon, they may cost less and convey more, but transfers may become excessive. Interpreting such institutions as social security, the authors introduce private saving. With time, social security crowds out savings. Still, the potential to save limits any excess transfer. Endogenous costly-to-create ""gold"" money institutions are examined, and the role of compulsion in evolving to costless-to-create fiat currency detailed."

We test this implication of the hypothesis by examining the implied cross-equation restrictions on a vector autoregression (VAR) model using U.S. data for the period ranging from 1929 to 1988. Our formal tests reject the hypothesis for the full sample period, but cannot reject it for the post-1947 period. Further investigations show that the statistical rejection should be attributed to sharp differences in the statistical properties of the pre-1947 and the post-1947 data rather than the failure of the hypothesis itself."

Changes in growth rates surrounding NBER troughs are found to be larger than changes surrounding peaks, and the probability of a direct contraction to recovery transition is found to be higher than the probability of a direct recovery to contraction transition. These findings suggest caution in interpreting empirical tests of economic series that assume symmetry and motivate theoretic models in which additions to capacity, production, and employment at the end of a recession are not mirror images of the cutbacks at the end of an expansion."

The resulting equilibrium is dynamically inefficient. In reality, however, parents realize that children will respond to higher parental saving by reducing gifts. For a broad class of gift economies, this implicit tax on saving pushes the equilibrium to dynamic efficiency. This result reestablishes the potential relevance of the model to the U.S. economy, renders moot an important part of the Ricardian equivalence debate, and provides a motivation for a type of social security system."

However, the estimated seasonal coefficients in production and sales are highly correlated, which should not be the case if firms smooth production in the face of anticipated seasonal movements in sales. A further test of the model, which implies production should follow a random walk with drift, provides mixed results but particularly negative results at the seasonal frequencies."

Upward wage pressures in some industries are tempered by downward adjustments in others. Only that portion of unemployment that is net of the effects of compositional shifts in the structure of labor demand influence nominal wage growth. Once unemployment has been purged of the effects of sectoral shifts, the apparent instability of the Phillips curve is resolved. This result holds for various measures of sectoral shifts."

The author shows that a commitment dominates an ordinary debt contract when investment proje cts have random returns that are costly to observe and random costs that are completely unobservable. The fees charged on commitments reduce default risk, which in turn permits larger loans than under ordinary debt contracts. The author's results contribute to the theoretical literature on financial intermediation and square with several styli zed facts about commitment contracts."

The authors find that, once they allow for the impulse response of GNP to be asymmetric, negative innovations to GNP are observed to be much less persistent than positive ones. In particular, the effect of a recession on the forecast of output is found to be negligible after only eight to twelve quarters, while the effect of a positive shock is estimated to be persistent and amplified over time. The authors' results may, therefore, help reconcile two antagonistic views about the nature of business-cycle fluctuations."

This paper reexamines such a claim in the context of a model in which money reduces transactions costs. It is shown that modeling money as an intermediate good does not necessarily imply that the optimal inflation tax is zero. The optimality of a zero inflation tax depends on the properties of the transactions costs technology. In particular, if the transactions costs technology does not exhibit constant returns to scale, it is optimal to resort to the inflation tax."

A temporary substitution of debt for taxation significantly increases consumption, work, and output initially--the same effects as in the Keynesian case where the implied future tax liability is not perceived. In contrast to the Keynesian case, investment also increases initially. In the long run, however, deficit finance significantly reduces investment, work, output, and consumption."

This measure is a special case of expansion path subadditivity and contains economies of scope as a special case. A nonparametric frontier technique which isolates the effects of inefficiency and scale is used to measure economies of diversification. Applied to a set of 468 U.S. depository institutions operating in 1984, the authors find slight diseconomies of diversification. Diseconomies of diversification and inefficiency due to the overutilization of resources are found to be more important determinants of bank costs than is the failure to operate at optimal scale.

The model shows that a subsidy to one type of capital financed by a tax on another capital good lowers growth.

Even when Walras's law fails, a Walrasian equilibrium may be optimal in a three-period model depending on the endowment and generational structure. If middle-aged generations have sufficiently high income so that both the old and the young are net borrowers, transactions are generation-by-generation bilaterally balanced, thus ruling out potentially better but unenforceable contracts in equilibrium and ensuring competitive efficiency. When there are imbalances, fiat money, which serves as a medium of intergenerational exchanges, becomes valuable."

A crucial point is that a constraint on the utility of money yields the wealth effect that inflation will reduce the real value of assets.

Two conditions are required for convergence. Shocks to relative regional per-capita incomes should be temporary (stochastic convergence) and initially poor regions should catch up to rich regions ([beta]-convergence). The authors find evidence for stochastic convergence across U.S. regions during the 1929-90 period after allowing for a trend break in 1946. They also find that U.S. regions have achieved [beta]convergence. These findings support the neoclassical model's prediction of conditional convergence.

661,"AB: Much of the new growth literature stresses country characteristics, such as education levels or political stability, as the dominant determinant of growth. However, growth rates are highly unstable over time, with a correlation across decades of 0.1 to 0.3, while country characteristics are stable, with cross-decade correlations of 0.6 to 0.9. Shocks, especially those to terms of trade, play a large role in explaining variance in growth. These findings suggest either that shocks are important relative to country characteristics in determining long-run growth or that worldwide technological change determines long-run growth while country characteristics determine relative income levels. Coauthors are Michael Kremer, Lant Pritchett, and Lawrence H. Summers."

Supplementary evidence suggests that the causation runs from macroeconomic policy to growth. The framework makes it possible to identify the channels of these effects: inflation reduces growth by reducing investment and productivity growth, budget deficits also reduce both capital accumulation and productivity growth. Examination of exceptional cases shows that while low inflation and small deficits are not necessary for high growth even over long periods, high inflation is not consistent with sustained growth."

The authors construct an endogenous growth model in which financial systems evaluate prospective entrepreneurs, mobilize savings to finance the most promising productivity-enhancing activities, diversify the risks associated with these innovative activities, and reveal the expected profits from engaging in innovation rather than the production of existing goods using existing methods. Better financial systems improve the probability of successful innovation and thereby accelerate economic growth. Similarly, financial sector distortions reduce the rate of economic growth by reducing the rate of innovation. A broad battery of evidence suggests that financial systems are important for productivity growth and economic development."

Object gaps are emphasized by mainstream economists who make use of formal models and statistical hypothesis tests. Idea gaps are emphasized by dissident economists who make use of a diverse body of evidence and avoid formal models. Economists need to use the formal models from the first approach and the diverse evidence from the second to fully appreciate the importance of idea gaps in economic development.

The method identifies the revenue raised by different taxes at the general government level and defines aggregate measures of the corresponding tax bases. This method yields estimates of effective tax rates on factor incomes and consumption consistent with the tax distortions faced by a representative agent in a general equilibrium framework. These tax rates compare favorably with existing estimates of marginal tax rates and highlight important international differences in tax policy."

The high frequency of small wage changes is inconsistent with menu cost models that censor small wage changes. The evidence supporting nominal wage rigidity is a small spike at zero in the nominal wage growth distribution and incomplete indexing of nominal wage growth to unanticipated inflation."

This paper argues that the importance of a productivity shock in explaining the variance of output is fundamentally indeterminate. Any model that is in accord with the several time series that make up United States macroeconomic data must feature multiple shocks that are correlated at all leads and lags. Sorting out the separate effects of these various shocks on a single variable such as real GNP is impossible. We illustrate this argument using a multiple-shock version of the King Plosser-Rebelo (1980) benchmark real business cycle model."

106,"AB: This paper develops a general equilibrium model in which monetary disturbances have effects reminiscent of Roosa's classic description of the availability doctrine. The model is a marriage of the modern credit rationing literature and the recent sluggish cash flow models of monetary transmission. Both elements are crucial. The credit rationing aspect leads to a focus upon the quantity or availability of credit. However, the rationing model in and of itself is a real model, and there is no reason for fluctuations in the nominal quantity of fiat money to have any effect on the availability of real credit. This is where the sluggish cash flow assumption enters into the analysis. Under this assumption, changes in the nominal supply of fiat money do affect the real supply of credit because a subset of the economy absorbs a disproportionate share of the monetary injection."

In this paper, a model which captures important aspects of Schumpeter's notion of 'trustified capitalism' is developed. Innovating firms capture market share from their rivals but do not drive them out of business. Most of the results of earlier models carry over. For example, the determinants of the growth rate of quality are exactly the same as in previous models. However, two differences do arise. In contrast to previous models, quality growth is guaranteed by diminishing returns to scale in R&D. Also in contrast to previous models, the laissez faire growth rate is unambiguously below the socially optimal growth rate. The lack of ambiguity occurs because the negative profit destruction externality is weakened when innovating firms capture only part of their rivals' market share."

Our strategy is based on that developed by Doan, Litterman, and Sims (1984), who constructed a procedure for improving time series forecasts by shrinking vector autoregression coefficient estimates toward a prior view that vector time series are well-described as collections of independent random walks. In our case, the prior is derived from a fully-specified general equilibrium model.

Because individual traders in the search economy do not internalize the positive effects inventory accumulation and search effort have on the aggregate economy, they are too low relative to social efficiency. It is established that a tax on money balances can alleviate these externalities and improve aggregate welfare. It does so by (1) directly increasing the optimal search intensity choices of the individual trader and (2) stimulating the accumulation of inventories through a 'Mundell-Tobin' type effect. An increase in the equilibrium level of inventory accumulation also positively affects search effort. The implications for optimal monetary policy are discussed."

There is both aggregate national consumption risk and nondiversifiable individual-specific risk. Countries engage in an optimal risk-sharing arrangement to pool risk associated with the aggregate consumption endowment streams. Welfare gains are associated with reduced consumption variability and with the international pricing of the consumption streams of individual countries. The paper considers the standard von Neumann-Morgenstern time-additive preferences as well as nonexpected utility and habit formation preferences. Large unexploited gains are found under all sets of preferences, leading to an international risk-sharing puzzle."

They can however shift income distribution towards 'workers' or individuals who own no accumulated factors of production and have no incentives to save any portion of their income flows in balanced-growth equilibrium. This may help explain why labor's political representatives often favor provisions that decrease socially desirable labor mobility."

We develop a regional credit view to explain how, due to information costs, regional banking conditions can affect local economic activity by impacting on a region's ability to fund local investments. Localized information costs suggest that banking-sector problems may constrain economic activity in financially distressed regions, whereas no such link need be evident in financially sound regions. We test for the empirical relevance of this asymmetry for the 1983-90 period using state level data and find evidence that local banking-sector conditions explain more of real personal income growth in states where bank loan quality has been poor than in those where banking conditions are relatively healthy."

The hypothesis that monetary authorities manage interest rates so as to smooth their movements, while also resisting changes in exchange rates, is attractive conceptually and is capable of explaining not only the 'Beta' = -3 finding but also several other notable features of the data."

The nature and amount of monetary independence is specified, informally and in a formal model, and quantified with Swedish krona data. Altogether the amount of monetary independence appears sizable. For instance, an increase in the Swedish krona band from zero to about [plus or minus] 2 percent may reduce the krona interest rate's standard deviation by about a half."

If the private sector can coordinate, then a low but nonzero inflation outcome can be supported as a subgame-perfect and chisel-proof credible noncooperative equilibrium. For an atomistic private sector, the result can still hold in a game between successive monetary administrations."

Here the author employs classical methods of business cycle analysis to determine how well the cyclical properties of simulated data from a representative real business cycle model match up with postwar U.S. business cycle characteristics. While the simulated model reproduces qualitative features consistent with observed business cycle experience, quantitative goodness-of-fit tests show that, for many sectors of the economy, the cyclical characteristics of the simulated data deviate significantly from U.S. business cycle experience."

Using the methods developed by Burns and Mitchell (1946), we see if we can distinguish between the economic series generated by an actual economy and those analogous artificial series generated by a stochastically perturbed economic model. In the case of the Adelmans, the model corresponded to the Klein-Goldberger equations. In our case, the model corresponds to a simple real business cycle model. The results indicate a fairly high degree of coincidence in key economic aggregates between the business cycle characteristics identified in actual data and those found in our simulated economy."

In particular, modeling fluctuations in personal and corporate income tax rates increases the model's predicted relative variability of hours and decreases its predicted correlation between hours and average productivity. Fluctuations in tax rates produce large substitution effects that alter the leisure/labor supply decision."

The proposed solution method replaces the true budget constraints and Euler equations of economic agents with loglinear approximations. The model then becomes a system of loglinear expectational difference equations, which can be solved by the method of undetermined coefficients. The paper uses this technique to study shocks to technology and shocks to government spending financed by lump-sum or distortionary taxation. It emphasizes that the persistence of shocks is an important determinant of their macroeconomic effects."

The results are robust to alternative enhancements to raw labor input measures and to the inclusion of additional relevant variables often correlated with economic growth in developing countries. The evidence supports the theoretical suggestion that labor skill is a useful augmentation of the raw labor measure commonly used in empirical growth studies.

The model economy consists of a real side that is the standard real business cycle model and a monetary side that amounts of imposing cash-in-advance constraints on certain market transactions. The paper also considers the effect of assuming a rigidity in the typical household's cash savings choice. The competitive equilibrium of the economy is not Pareto efficient, partly because of two distortions: a distortion on the capital accumulation decision and a distortion on portfolio choice that arises from the assumed rigidity. The principal result of the paper is that the interest rate rule (but not the money growth rule) entirely eliminates these two distortions and is thus the benevolent central banker's policy choice."

This motivates the design of long-run restrictions to identify a structural vector autoregression, employing data from the post-World War I Germany and the post-World War II Chinese hyperinflationary episodes. The empirical results support the contention that both real and nominal shocks have important effects on the relative price and money demand during hyperinflations."

Cross-sectional differences in the structure of compensation contracts within banking are also examined. We find a positive and significant relation between the importance of equity-based incentives and the value of the bank's charter. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that compensation policies promote risk taking in banking."

At one extreme, we assume that bankers can default on payments they owe to governments. At the other, we assume that bankers are committed to honoring contracts made with governments. We show that if bankers can default, then a government gets enduring benefits from maintaining a good relationship with bankers and its reputation can support a large amount of borrowing. If, however, bankers must honor their contracts, then a government gets only transient benefits from maintaining a good relationship and its reputation can support zero borrowing."

If income is influenced by more than one factor, then one cannot expect a given cross-section of income levels to converge in the same manner at every point in time and for every set of countries even if each country's income level is generated by the same economic model."

Cointegration and common-cycle tests are performed, sectoral output data seem to share a relatively high number of common trends and a relatively low number of common cycles. A special trend-cycle decomposition of the data set is performed, and the results indicate a very similar cyclical behavior across sectors and very different behavior for trends. In a variance decomposition analysis, prominent sectors such as Manufacturing and Wholesale/Retail Trade exhibit relatively important transitory shocks."

Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the GMM estimates are often biased (apparently due to poor instruments), statistically insignificant, economically implausible, and dynamically unstable. The ML estimates are generally unbiased (even in misspecified models), statistically significant, economically plausible, and dynamically stable.

393,"AB: This paper studies the relation between policies of financial repression, inflation rates, and long-term growth. We set up a model which shows that governments might want to repress the financial sector because this sector is an 'easy' source of resources for the public budget (the inflation tax). To the extent that the financial sector increases the efficiency of the allocation of savings to productive investment, the choice of the degree of financial development will have real effects on the growth rate of the economy. In countries where tax evasion is large the government will optimally choose to repress the financial sector in order to increase seigniorage taxation. This policy will then reduce the efficiency of the financial sector, increase the costs of intermediation, reduce the amount of investment, and reduce the growth rate of the economy. Financial repression will therefore be associated with high tax evasion, low growth, and high inflation."

We start from the well-known Long-Plosser-McCallum real business cycle model and extend it in two directions: First, money is introduced, still maintaining the market clearing assumption. Secondly, this monetary model is studied under the assumption of predetermined wages. An explicit solution is given in both cases. It appears that the combination of money and nonclearing markets allows to give a synthetic view between usual 'real business cycles' results and traditional Keynesian ones. We apply it in particular to specify the cyclical properties of real wages and prices."

Implicitly, the monetary base assumes that the economic effects of changes in reserve requirements are identical to those due to changes in high-powered money. Theory, however, does not generally support the prediction that the two policy tools will have the same economic effects. Structural VARs are estimated to compare the short-run paths of inflation and output growth under two different types of policy shocks. In doing so, this analysis gives one a measure of the costs associated with this implicit equivalence assumption. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the Federal Reserve at least partially offsets reserve requirement changes with open market operations and the hypothesis that dynamic explanations of macroeconomic variables are improved by separating reserve requirement changes from other monetary policy moves."

In equilibrium, markups are inversely related to the aggregate capital stock, which makes it possible for the marginal revenue product of capital to be nonmonotonic, even if the marginal product of capital is strictly diminishing. That feature raises the possibility of multiple steady states and, most interestingly, multiple equilibrium paths (converging to different steady states) for given initial conditions. The author concludes by discussing some of the predictions of his model and assessing their empirical relevance."

Our analysis both performs specification tests as well as measures the deviations of the data from each null model through use of a noise ratio statistic. A second purpose is to explore whether observed cost shocks, in particular raw materials prices, help explain inventory movements. We find that the production smoothing model of inventories, augmented by buffer stock motives, stockout avoidance motives, and observed cost shocks, well approximates monthly data."

Cross-sectional analysis is used to estimate both the probability and the conditional price of risk associated with FSLIC default. The results suggest that increased uncertainty about both output and inflation in this disaster scenario drove the price of FSLIC default risk to extremely high levels.

682,"AB: Recent work in macroeconomics argues that imperfections in capital markets may lead to business cycle fluctuations by propagating relatively modest shocks. Evidence for such a mechanism (also known as the 'financial accelerator') consists largely of firm-level studies showing that cash flow is an important predictor of investment. But this evidence is often viewed with skepticism because cash flow is also a good indicator of investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop a framework for estimating the extent to which the predictive power of cash flow can be attributed to its role as a 'fundamental' versus its role in alleviating credit frictions. For firms with access to commercial paper and bond markets, we find that the perfect capital markets model of investment can fully account for the role of cash flow. For firms with only limited access to capital markets (as indicated by lack of participation in public debt markets) however, investment appears to be 'excessively' sensitive to fluctuations in cash flow. These results thus clarify the role of cash flow in investment equations and provide support for the existence of a financial accelerator.Q"

699,"AB: Private information is introduced into the Kiyotaki-Wright model of commodity money in terms of qualitative uncertainty concerning the good which would be the unique medium of exchange under complete information. Producers are allowed to produce high- or low-quality versions of that good, and people may not always recognize its quality. It is shown that commodities that suffer from qualitative uncertainty may still be used as the medium of exchange when the private information problem is not too severe. This is so despite the fact that, in some equilibria, there is necessarily some low-quality commodity money in circulation. When the information problem is so severe that the good of uncertain quality cannot be the unique money, there can exist an equilibrium with dual commodity monies of which one is the good subject to qualitative uncertainty."

The extracted Markov switching factor may be interpreted as the coincident index and is comparable to the Stock-Watson index which differs only by the Markov switching component. Using four constituent series of the DOC coincident index for the period January 1960 to June 1992, the proposed model generates recessionary and expansionary periods which are remarkably consistent with the NBER chronology of the business cycles from the noisy monthly data. This paper also finds that duration dependence does matter."

In fact, economic theory suggests that cointegration is unlikely to be observed in efficient markets. However, this paper finds evidence for the predictability of relative returns and the existence of a 'winner-loser' effect across sixteen national equity markets. A conclusion is that national stock-market indices include a common world component and two country-specific components, one permanent and one transitory."

These procedures are used to examine augmenting M2 with stock and/or bond mutual funds. The alternative aggregates are broadly similar to M2 but during 1992-93 they outperform M2."

Although individually none of the distortions is very large, they combine to yield substantial welfare cost estimates. A sustained 4 percent inflation like that experienced in the United States since 1983 costs the economy the equivalent of 0.41 percent of output per year when currency is identified as the relevant definition of money and over 1 percent of output per year when M1 is defined as money. The results illustrate how the traditional, partial equilibrium approach can seriously underestimate the true cost of inflation."

Their continued adherence to bimetallism could have avoided much of the deflation in the gold standard world in the 1870s.

In contrast, it is the argument of this paper that this evidence is not convincing. The most robust evidence suggests that the typical U.S. manufacturing industry displays constant returns with no external effects.

When commitment is prohibitively expensive, the allocation is similar to the Townsend equilibrium.

Strong evidence is found for conditional convergence of the 48 contiguous U.S. states and a group of 54 countries. Our evidence does not support theories in which trend growth rates differ across economies endogenously."

Therefore, the expectations of future tighter monetary policy make the domestic currency appreciate, even though the current monetary effects of the intervention are typically offset by central banks. Of course, this explanation presumes that central banks in fact back up interventions with subsequent changes in monetary policy. In this paper, the authors empirically examine this presumption."

The conditions depend not just on the physical productivity of the different components of public expenditure but also on the initial shares. Using data from 43 developing countries over 20 years we show that an increase in the share of current expenditure has positive and statistically significant growth effects. By contrast, the relationship between the capital component of public expenditure and per-capita growth is negative. Thus, seemingly productive expenditures, when used in excess, could become unproductive. These results imply that developing-country governments have been misallocating public expenditures in favor of capital expenditures at the expense of current expenditures."

A dynamic general equilibrium model is constructed with the introduction of monopolistic competition and nominal price rigidity in a standard real business cycle model, allowing for an endogenous money supply rule. It is then demonstrated that sticky price models can explain the observed associations between movements in inflation and output much better than flexible price models. This result depends little on whether money supply is assumed to be endogenous or not."

None of these hypotheses are supported by the data. The OPEC price increases do appear to have had significant impacts, while the effects of the price declines of the 1980s are smaller and harder to characterize.

A positive correlation emerges between growth and financial development. The optimal degree of monitoring depends on factor prices and increases with capital accumulation.

In particular, cyclical variations in labor 'effort' take place as a response to expected future changes in industry conditions. I test the restrictions imposed by the model for several two-digit manufacturing industries under different assumptions about market structure and returns to scale. Then, using the assumption that aggregate variables carry information about future changes in industry conditions, I simulate the model's dynamic response of hours and productivity to aggregate innovations and compare them to those estimated from the data."

In contrast to previous models of this genre, the lender can induce self-selection either by rationing a fraction of borrowers, or by using a costly screening technology, or by a mix of the two. The equilibrium contract's form and the growth rate of output are mutually dependent and are jointly determined. The effect of the lower cost of screening on the growth rate of output has been considered. We show that a decline in the screening cost, paradoxically, may lower the growth rate of output. Only when a threshold level of sophistication is crossed will the benefit of an advanced financial sector become evident in a higher growth rate."

Both of these features are important in generating the conclusion that, even when trade only represents a small share of output, tariffs can have a significant impact on GDP. Simulation of the model suggests that the global escalation of the tariff war precipitated the collapse of world trade, along with declines of several percent in international output and investment."

The idea is to calibrate the model economies to match features of the U.S. earnings distribution and then examine the wealth distribution implications of the model economies. The findings are that the calibrated model economies with earnings and lifetime uncertainty can replicate measures of both aggregate wealth and transfer wealth in the United States. Furthermore, the model economies produce the U.S. wealth Gini and a significant fraction of the wealth inequality within age groups. However, the model economies produce less than half the fraction of wealth held by the top 1 percent of U.S. households."

The purpose of this paper is to measure the effect that systematic variation in the IES of poor and rich consumers has on the IES of aggregate consumption expenditure. The authors find economically significant differences in the IES of poor and rich consumers in Indian panel data on the consumption of individual households. They also find economically significant differences in the IES measured in aggregate time series data for the United States and India.

This study uses a well-known class of stochastic growth models to show other difficulties with traditional empirical studies of convergence. Key parameters typically cannot be estimated consistently in cross-section regressions. When the parameters are assumed known, implications for convergence are unavailable except under restrictive and economically unmotivated assumptions. Those same assumptions that relate key parameters to cross-country convergence render cross-section regressions impossible to estimate consistently."

The main conclusions of the paper are: (1) when increased specialization is a necessary condition for growth, sustained growth may not start if financial intermediaries do not emerge and in this sense, intermediaries are a necessary condition for growth to start and persist, and (2) when firms specialize, intermediaries endogenously emerge because they prevent the duplication of monitoring effort. Thus, it is specialization in the real sector which causes the emergence of intermediaries."

When macroeconomic variables, including oil price shocks, are included in the model, their results continue to hold.

806,"AB: With loan commitments negotiated in advance, the use of 'tight money' to restrain nominal spending has asymmetric effects upon different categories of borrowers. This can reduce efficiency, even though aggregate demand is stabilized. An equilibrium model of financial intermediation with loan commitments is developed and used to analyze the welfare consequences of alternative monetary policies. If demand uncertainty relates primarily to the number of borrowers rather than to each one's demand for credit, an interest-rate smoothing policy is optimal."

836,"AB: This paper studies how government liabilities affect macroeconomic aggregates in a standard general equilibrium growth model. There are two principal results: (1) Though it is often thought that fiscal deficits crowd out investment, this paper shows that deficit-financed cuts in distortionary income taxation may stimulate investment even if agents expect future taxes on capital income to be higher. This result is dependent on the values of two key parameters: the elasticity of labor supply and the degree of persistence in the government debt process. (2) The economy's response to an increase in government expenditure depends on how it is financed. Distortionary tax finance may lead to a decline in output, consumption, and investment. In contrast, deficit finance may increase output and consumption."

851,"AB: Dramatic fluctuations in the stock market raise questions about whether actual asset prices correspond to the expected present value of future cash flow and whether deviations from this fundamental price can affect real investment spending. Even if there are deviations from fundamental price, they may not distort real behavior if firms ignore these deviations in making their investment decisions. On the other hand, overvaluation of equities could provide firms with a relatively cheap source of finance and might therefore influence investment. To evaluate these issues, this paper introduces a new econometric testing strategy, and assesses the existence of stock market bubbles and the sensitivity of investment spending to bubbles. We estimate the Q and Euler equations in a simultaneous equations model and exploit the idea that these equations reflect different information about the stock market and investment spending. Based on U.S. data for 1911-87, our formal statistical tests indicate that bubbles exist but real investment decisions are based on fundamentals. A variety of robustness checks and three types of collateral evidence corroborate this interpretation."

The authors remedy this shortcoming by providing a computer program that calculates marginal income tax rates for all income levels for the years 1930 to 1990. They conduct a preliminary empirical investigation into the effect of taxes on economic growth. The authors find that lowering taxes significantly raises economic growth and that changing the tax rate schedule also has significant effects on economic growth."

When they calibrate the model to U.S. and Japanese data, they find that first-order risk aversion substantially increases excess return predictability. However, this increased predictability is insufficient to match the data. The authors conclude that the observed patterns of excess return predictability are unlikely to be explained purely by time-varying risk premiums generated by highly risk averse agents in a complete markets economy."

However, the apparent pattern of precautionary wealth is not consistent with a standard parameterization of the life cycle model in which consumers are patient enough to begin saving for retirement early in life, wealth is estimated to be far less sensitive to uncertainty than implied by that model. Instead, the authors' results suggest that over most of their working life time, consumers behave in accordance with the 'buffer-stock' models of saving described in Carroll (1992, 1997) or Deaton (1991), in which consumers hold wealth principally to insulate consumption against near-term fluctuations in income."

Next, long-run restrictions are used to separate structural errors with temporary effects from those with permanent effects. Finally, it is assumed that the oil price is affected by only a single structural trend. This identifies a trend, which has a structural interpretation as a natural resource constraint, and another trend with positive drift, interpreted as productivity."

172,"AB: To empirically discriminate between Ricardian and non-Ricardian behavior, the author must use a method that distinguishes between expected and unexpected, as well as permanent and transitory changes in taxes and government consumption. One method that provides these distinctions between different types of changes is the common trends framework used in this paper, which is a VAR model with cointegrating constraints. In the empirical study of US data, there is some support for the Ricardian hypothesis, but there are also some deviations from its predictions. However, the differences do not lend support to a Keynesian view of budget deficits, but rather to the view of expansionary fiscal contractions. This can be motivated theoretically by uncertainty about future taxes in combination with prudent households."

This paper argues that these puzzles derive from an identification of monetary policy that is inappropriate for such economies. To remedy this, it is proposed that a structural model be estimated to explicitly account for the features of the small open economy. Such a model is applied to Canada with tightly estimated results overall. The dynamic responses to the identified monetary policy shock are consistent with standard theory and highlight the exchange rate as a transmission mechanism."

In addition, relative prices of these goods have displayed substantial variation over the postwar period. This paper reports that incorporating a source of empirically plausible relative price variability makes the framework's implications for comovement even worse, compounding the comovement problem. The possibility that complementarities in the production of household and business capital may help account for observed comovement is considered. The results suggest that complementarities improved the framework's empirical performance."

223,"AB: The authors examine the two ways in which US commercial banks organized their investment banking operations before the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act forced the banks to leave the securities business: as an internal securities department within the bank and as a separately incorporated affiliate with its own board of directors. While departments underwrote seemingly higher quality firms and securities than did comparable affiliates, the departments obtained lower prices for the issues they underwrote. The higher risk premium associated with the internal department is consistent with investors discounting for the greater likelihood of conflicts of interest when lending and underwriting are within the same structure. As a result, commercial banks evolved toward choosing the separate affiliate structure. The authors' results suggest that internal structure is an effective commitment mechanism, and absent other distortions, market pressures would propel banks to adopt an internal structure that would address regulators' concerns about conflicts of interest."

Bank choices in debt reduction programs are aimed at maximizing the magnitude of their transfer from regulatory agencies. As a result, bank choices reflect their characteristics, including financial strength and exposure to the debtor country. The directions of influence correspond to the predictions of the authors' model."

This paper demonstrates that these comovements can be resolved by introducing endogenous growth into the model, while retaining only a single technology shock to market production.

291,AB: The legislative framework under which the Reserve Bank of New Zealand operates was changed in 1989 to one providing for a tightly constructed target (rule) with discretion over instrument choice. The rationale for the change rests on the idea that damage to long-run growth would follow if monetary policy were to pay active attention to the short-run output and employment consequences of monetary policy actions. The rule now in place thus prohibits monetary policy from active consideration of output and employment as objectives in their own right. Initial results provide tentative evidence of the benefits of the approach.

Estimating the model on post-war US data, we find that the revealed weight on price surprises is significant, but only around a third of that on inflation. The estimated elasticity of output with respect to price surprises is around one-quarter, but statistically insignificant."

Nevertheless, the price level is sticky in a range of mark-up indeterminacy and inflation occurs only when employment presses against capacity. Under full information, the monetary authority can exploit price level stickiness to minimize the mark-up and keep employment at a constrained optimum without inflation. Under uncertainty, negative aggregate demand shocks produce real contractions and positive shocks raise the price level. The monetary authority can raise the likelihood that aggregate demand will maximize employment, but at the cost of higher expected inflation."

Second, to the extent that the absence of any precommitment technology is nevertheless a problem, it will apply to a consolidated central bank-plus-government entity as well as to the central bank alone.

Three results emerge: leisure is countercyclical while nonmarket hours are acyclical, hours spent in home production have declined significantly during the 1970s, fluctuations in market output are a good measure of fluctuations in individual utility as long as home and market consumption are either extreme complements or extreme substitutes in the production of utility."

Second, a highly significant t-value may come from sources different from asymmetry. Using international data, the authors investigate for the presence of asymmetric persistence across the G-7 countries."

It has been argued that multi-sector growth models are inconsistent with this observation when changes in relative productivities are the main source of fluctuations. The authors suggest that the input-output structure of economy, in particular the pervasive use of intermediate inputs, can induce positive comovement in sectoral employment and output following changes in relative productivities. They calibrate a model of the U.S. economy for the durable and nondurable goods producing sectors and show that sectoral employment and output move together if intermediate inputs are used in production. The model is also consistent with the observation that the relative price on nondurable goods in procyclical."

First, to more tightly link theory and evidence. They think a good way of achieving this would be to follow the methodology common in the business cycle literature of simulating models to compare their predictions to the data. Second, to develop new ways to empirically distinguish between competing theories of endogenous growth. Third, to develop more theories of international productivity differences.

In fact, bringing down inflation is costly, presenting a challenge to the New Keynesian model. Two departures from the New Keynesian model predict costly disinflation. One assumes sticky inflation rather than sticky prices, while the other assumes less-than-perfectly rational expectations. Taking into account information from surveys of inflation expectations, the author finds the evidence suggests that inflation is not sticky and that inflation expectations are less than perfectly rational."

Using a new series of interest rate targets made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we develop a family of models that highlight the implications of discrete changes in interest rate targets for the term structure of interest rates. We show that spreads between short-term rates and the overnight federal reserve funds rate are mainly driven by expectations of changes in the target, not by the transitory dynamics of the overnight rate around the target. Hence, the bias in tests of the expectations hypothesis that we document can be mainly attributed to the erroneous anticipation of future changes in monetary policy. Our modeling assumptions and newly-available data make it possible to extract a series of market expectations of the next target change, which are compared with a series of realized target changes."

The model identifies circumstances in which 'perverse' responses to intervention will be observed, i.e. the domestic currency depreciates when the central bank purchases it, and it provides conditions under which the exchange rate will be highly sensitive to intervention. The model also provides an explanation for two forms of 'policy secrecy': (i) secrecy about the scale of an intervention operation is always desirable, (ii) secrecy about the target is sometimes desirable."

The approach is tested for a sample of fifteen OECD countries over the period 1974-89.

770,"AB: The authors compare the wealth effects of acquisitions of failed thrifts before and after the passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) in August 1989. In contrast to Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation assisted deals in the pre-FIRREA period, they find no evidence of significant acquirer gains in Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) assisted transactions. In addition, there is no significant correlation between acquirer gains and either the number of bidders or the amount of assistance provided by the RTC. These results suggest the absence of any symmetric tax-payer overpayments in RTC assisted transactions, and indicate that regulatory and institutional changes instituted by FIRREA resulted in an improvement in the resolution process for failed thrifts."

787,"AB: In practice, the interest rate sensitivity of depository institution (DI) net worth is measured in terms of maturity mismatches arising from nominal contracts in their financial portfolios. Academic studies also frequently invoke nominal contracting to explain a positive covariation observed between DI stock returns and bond returns. For a sample of thrifts reporting detailed financial data (1984-1992), this study estimates monthly changes in their financial portfolio values due to changes in interest rates. These portfolio value changes are found to be unimportant in explaining the thrifts' stock returns and are unable to account for a positive covariation between the stock returns and bond market returns. Potential weaknesses in the tests seem inadequate to explain the results. Explanations other than nominal contracting may warrant more consideration in relating DIs' net worth to interest rate changes."

However they assume that the log of real dividends follows a constant random walk with drift over the whole period. The authors show that this assumption is invalid, and that a Markov-switching model is a more appropriate representation of dividends. They then generalize the formulation of stock prices (including the intrinsic bubble) to allow for this, and show that regime-switching provides a better explanation for stock prices than the bubble. The authors show that when allowance is made both for the bubble and for regime-switching in the dividend process, the incremental explanatory contribution of the bubble is low."

A combination of theory and empirical work formed the basis of a monetary approach to the business cycle developed in Geneva. The proposed policy of price level stabilization presumed that an elastic target of price stability was a necessary condition for (eventual) high and stable employment. The instruments, indicator variables and 'rules' of the proposed regime are examined. The Geneva economists founded their arguments on, among other things, politically independent but internationally collaborative central banks, and consistent use of a range of data sources in the conduct of monetary policy. Over time the reputation and credibility of monetary authorities would then be enhanced. In the evolution of the monetary policy 'rules' versus 'discretion' debate, the contribution of the Geneva economists should be accorded a central place."

138,AB: This paper examines links between innovation in the U.S. intermediating sector and financial deepening from 1872-1929. Technical progress is modeled in a credit-rationing framework with limited liability as an enhanced ability of intermediaries to monitor loan recipients. This allows an innovating lender to earn temporary rents by lowering loan rates and inducing firms with higher repayment prospects to apply. Rents persist until others adopt the improvement and competition for loanable funds raises the deposit rate. Subsequent deposits ensure that more funds are channeled to projects of higher average quality. The link between the loan-deposit spread and financial deepening implied by the model is then examined in an unobservable components framework. The finding that permanent reductions of 1% in the spread of New York banks are associated with increases in financial depth that range from 1.7 percent to nearly 4 percent is consistent with a role for efficiency improvements in the rapid financial deepening that characterized the pre-1930 U.S. economy.

155,"AB: This paper explores the determinants of the adjustment matrix in error correction models within two intertemporal models of the firm. In a production smoothing model of inventories, it is shown that the adjustment matrix contains the speed of adjustment of inventories as conjectured in previous work but this parameter matrix also contains the parameters from the autoregressive polynomials associated with the stochastic, unobservable shocks in the model. Two empirical examples are provided suggesting that these unobservable shocks cannot be assumed to be serially uncorrelated. In a flexible wage model of a labor market, the impact upon the adjustment matrix of normalizing the cointegrating matrix is studied. In contrast to one-state variable problems, normalization of the cointegrating matrix is arbitrary on economic and statistical grounds in this model and it is shown that, even with serially uncorrelated shocks, estimating the elements of the adjustment matrix may not provide an estimate of the speed of adjustment under some normalizations of the cointegrating matrix. The implication of the analysis is that without guidance from an economic model about the interpretation of elements of the adjustment matrix under alternative normalizations of the cointegrating matrix, or when unobservable shocks are serially correlated, economic interpretation of estimates of the adjustment matrix will be hazardous."

Findings indicate that the relation between income, money, prices, and interest rates is stable, as long as sufficient data are used, and that there is cointegration among the variables considered, although cointegration spaces become very difficult to estimate precisely when smaller windows of data are used. Further, both M1 and M2 are shown to be important predictors of income for the entire period from 1960:2-1996:3, based on modified versions of what the author terms the 'most damaging' specifications from Friedman and Kuttner (1993) and Thoma (1994).

The fact that economists use a large number of filters to extract the 'cyclical' and 'trend' components of time series simply means that these concepts do not have unique meaning among them. Alternative filters provide different windows through which economists can examine their models and data. It is an open question as to whether some of these windows are more or less interesting to look through. The fact that some economists restrict themselves to a small set of filters is an issue to the extent that they thereby induce a lack of power.

This model incorporates a different role for government debt than is found in standard models, and it captures different cost-benefit trade-offs. On the benefit side, government debt enhances the liquidity of households by providing an additional means of smoothing consumption and by effectively loosening borrowing constraints. On the cost side, the implied taxes have adverse wealth distribution and incentive effects. In addition, government debt crowds out capital via higher interest rates and lowers per capita consumption."

272,"AB: The authors use consumption-based CAPM models (with fixed and flexible wages) to analyze the effect of central bank operating procedures on the ex ante real rate of return on a one-period nominal bond. They show that operating procedures affect both the risk-free rate and the risk premium. Nominal interest rate targeting produces the highest real interest rates, money targeting produces the lowest rates, and nominal income targeting comes out somewhere in between. The authors' simulations suggest that the central bank's choice of operating procedure may make as much as fifty or one hundred basis points difference in the real rate of interest. The role of monetary aggregates has diminished in most central banks' operating procedures, and this provides one explanation for the common perception that real interest rates may have risen. Nevertheless, their analysis also demonstrates that there is no presumption that monetary targeting dominates from a welfare point of view."

(1992) have suggested that an augmented Solow growth model can account for 80 percent of the variation in output per capita across countries due to different steady-state growth paths that result from differences in saving rates, education, and population growth. This paper carries their analysis one step further and asks whether changes in the growth rate between the 1960s and the 1980s can also be explained by this framework. The authors results provide further support for several of Mankiw et al.'s key conclusions--investment in physical capital, population growth, and the initial levels of output seem to matter a great deal. However, investment in human capital has no ability to account for changes in growth rates over time. They conclude that investment in physical capital seems to be quite important for economic growth, though the reasons for this importance may not be fully captured by the augmented Solow growth model."

Instead, in the context of a monetary regime with an instrument-independent central bank and an inflation target (the goal) set by the government, C. Walsh's (1995) contracts serve a different purpose: namely, they provide an efficient signaling device that eliminates the political monetary cycle, results in the election of competent governments, and increases social welfare."

When they result from disturbances to the goods market, the variance of output is a decreasing function of the trend inflation rate. When both disturbances are significant, there exists, in general, a critical nonzero trend inflation rate that minimizes the variance of output."

But the inflation-growth correlation is only present with high frequency data and with extreme inflation observations, there is no cross-sectional correlation between long-run averages of growth and inflation. The authors propose that examination of discrete high inflation crises (periods when inflation is above some threshold, which they propose to be 40 percent annual) helps unravel these empirical paradoxes. The authors establish a robust finding that growth falls sharply during discrete high inflation crises, then recovers rapidly and strongly after inflation falls."

Unlike Kahn's model of asset trade, the authors' model does not impose any unmotivated restrictions on short sales. Instead, it features complete markets and publicly observable asset transactions. Like Kahn's model, his model implies that allocations are (constrained) Pareto optimal. However, the implications of the authors' model for asset prices are considerably different. In particular, when all agents have log utility, asset prices satisfy an aggregation theorem, also, unlike Kahn's model, the model in this paper does worse than the standard representative agent model in terms of explaining the equity premium."

They also introduce divisible service sidepayments into the model and allow agents to bargain over bundles of goods, services and money in bilateral matches. In asymmetric matches, the agent that values the other's good more dearly will typically have to make a substantial service sidepayment to complete the bargain. When sidepayments transfer utility imperfectly, the general equilibrium is inefficient. Agents barter too much. When barter is inefficient, a robust monetary equilibrium may exist which improves welfare. Both robust monetary equilibria and welfare-improving monetary equilibria require asymmetric matches, imperfectly transferable utility, and monetary exchange yields better expected terms of trade than barter. In contrast to other search models, money does not speed up trade."

Second, industries with rapidly declining prices for their capital and intermediate goods exhibit above-average TFP growth, which one would expect if improvements in variety and quality are only partially measured by output deflators: understated price declines upstream translate into higher measured TFP growth downstream."

557,"AB: An empirical investigation of the effects of fiscal policy on saving is carried out using Israeli data, which display large variability in both the saving rate and the fiscal variables. The framework is a small open economy model with distortionary taxation. The theoretical analysis of the partial effect of each fiscal variable on the national saving rate takes into account the necessary adjustment in future taxes. The present model predicts, for example, that the income-tax rate should have a negative effect on saving--in contrast to the Keynesian view--and that transfer payments and interest payments on the public debt should have positive effects--in contrast to the Ricardian view under lump-sum taxation. The empirical results partly support the predictions of the model--in particular for the income-tax rate. The methodology consists of two steps. First, quantitative predictions are obtained via simulation, and then the simulated effects are compared with the estimated coefficients."

Agents endogenously choose whether to become middlemen by investing in a technology of verifying quality. It is shown that there exists an equilibrium where middlemen always trade high-quality goods when the private information problem is not severe and the investment cost of quality-testing technology is not too high. When the private information problem is relatively severe, middlemen sometimes trade for low-quality goods. The trade-off to having agents engage in intermediation as opposed to production is considered to determine middlemen's welfare-improving role. It is found that when exchange is significantly delayed in the sense that people do not execute trades because they cannot recognize the true quality of goods, expert middlemen can improve welfare."

Employing ARCH-in-mean models for German money market rates confirms that more uncertainty reduces banks' demand for borrowed reserves and, thereby, leads to decreasing interest rates in the interbank money market."

This inability to account for the dynamics of U.S. aggregate data remains a major challenge to RBC theory. This paper demonstrates that reasonable modifications can bring RBC theory into closer conformity with the data.

The anticipated/unanticipated assumption influences measured output effects as much or more than the variable selection and shock orthogonalization assumptions on which the VAR literature focuses. Assuming that anticipated monetary policy can have some effect on output results in much shorter, smaller, and perhaps more believable estimates of the output response to monetary shocks."

In the presence of private information, it is Pareto efficient for the government to borrow in a way that amounts to nonlinear taxation, and it must treat agents with access to the best investment opportunities preferentially to keep them in the bond market. In addition, with private information about access to assets, it is often desirable to randomize extraneously the return on the highest yielding government liabilities. The optimal government policy is shown to accord well with historical observations and provides insight into why explicit randomization is not often observed in private contracts."

Closed-form solutions for moments of asset returns are derived. First-order approximations illustrate the effects of parameters and provide an algorithm to match the means and variances of the riskless rate and the rate of return on equity.

When trade policy is endogenous, there is a secondary gain from opening up financial markets, in addition to the direct risk-sharing benefits. By breaking the direct link between the terms of trade and welfare, international portfolio diversification can allow for a lower level of trade protection in a tariff game between governments. The authors apply the model to an estimation of the welfare gains from international financial markets. Their results show that these indirect 'trade' gains from financial markets are likely to be much larger than the direct 'risk-sharing' gains. In the tariff game with financial markets however, there are multiple equilibria. While one equilibrium allows for complete diversification and complete free trade, there are other equilibria in which there is limited diversification and a high level of average protection."

40,"AB: The political economy literature has enshrined as stylized fact the view that lower inflation and temporarily lower growth follow the election of Republican presidents and has emphasized political manipulation of monetary policy as an explanation. Support for the monetary explanation comes in econometric work that largely ignores identification issues that dominate the literature on measuring the effects of monetary policy. The authors generalize a standard vector autoregression framework to accommodate discrete, political party variables. They find almost no support for the view that political effects on the macroeconomy operate through monetary policy and only weak evidence that political effects are significant at all."

Unemployment flows and the unemployment rate are highly volatile, persistent, and countercyclical. Inflows lead the unemployment rate and the unemployment rate leads outflows over the business cycle. The one-sector stochastic growth model is augmented by matching frictions in the labor market and match-specific productivity shocks that introduce ex post heterogeneous job matches. Matching frictions help generate the lead-lag relationship between unemployment flows and the unemployment rate. Combined with heterogeneous job matches, they generate endogenous unemployment flows and an unemployment rate whose dynamic characteristics match observed data."

They focus on how the asymmetry of the corporate tax, imperfect loss carry-overs, endogenous financing with credit constraints, and different degrees of investment irreversibility affect both incremental investment and entry decisions. The authors find that, as long as capital can be financed with debt at the margin, the tax distortions on the marginal investment decision are small. This is particularly so if the technology is flexible. In contrast, the tax distortions on the entry decision are substantial. The ability of firms to carry over their losses and choose their financial structure endogenously are important for reducing both types of distortions."

104,"AB: The author studies the joint determination of market structure and growth in an oligopolistic economy. Firms run in-house R&D programs to produce over time a continuous flow of cost-reducing innovations. In symmetric equilibrium, the relation between market structure and growth has two aspects. First, a larger number of firms induces fragmentation of the market and dispersion of R&D resources. This prevents exploitation of scale economies internal to the firm and slows down growth. Second, the number of firms changes with market and technology conditions and is endogenous. In particular, R&D spending is a fixed cost and there is a negative feed-back of the rate of growth on the number of firms. The explicit consideration of the interdependence of market structure and growth identifies a fundamental trade-off between growth and variety that produces interesting results. For example, the scale effect is bounded from above and converges to zero when the number of firms is large. Moreover, the market grows too little and supplies too much variety. The inefficiency is not due to technological externalities but to oligopolistic pricing and the interaction between R&D and entry decisions."

134,"AB: The rising inflation of the 1970s inspired substantial theoretical analysis of the goals of central banks. In models with time-inconsistent monetary policy, central bankers are assumed to produce positive equilibrium inflation because they target an unemployment rate below the NAIRU. Ball (1995) notes that these models could explain the level of inflation but not its frequent and persistent movements. Although real shocks, as in Rogoff (1985), can produce temporary changes in inflation, Ball explains the recurrent and persistent movements in inflation throughout the past forty years with random changes in the preferences of the monetary policymakers, occurring even at the frequency of FOMC meetings. This paper provides empirical support that shifts in goals can indeed occur at this frequency. However, it is not necessarily the tastes of the policymakers that are changing, the FOMC's reading of the policy desired by the public can evolve over time, and if the FOMC is not completely goal-independent, it will accommodate these changes."

They start by documenting the difficulty that a standard variant of a conventional real business cycle model has in accounting for these facts. The authors then show how the introduction of intratemporal adjustment costs for investment can significantly enhance the performance of such a model. These costs make it difficult to alter the composition of production of new capital goods. The presence of these costs eliminates many counterfactual observations of the model that would otherwise be present. The dynamic response of variables in the model is different from what one would observe in the standard one-sector model. The authors also examine the implications of imposing intratemporal adjustment costs for labor. The model can also account for the cross-sector behavior of employment observed in the data."

With commitment, inflation has less persistence but more conditional variability, whereas output has more persistence and less conditional variability than with discretion. As the commitment strategy stabilizes the systematic component of inflation, it is less responsive to random shocks to inflation."

318,"AB: We consider a real business cycle model with an externality in production. Depending on parameter values, the model has sunspot equilibria, cyclical and chaotic equilibria, and equilibria with deterministic or stochastic regime switching. We study the implications of this model environment for automatic stabilizer tax systems. Stabilization is desirable because the efficient allocations are characterized by constant employment and output growth. We identify an automatic stabilizer income tax-subsidy schedule with two properties: (i) it specifies the tax rate to be an increasing function of aggregate employment, and (ii) earnings are subsidized when aggregate employment is at its efficient level. The first feature eliminates inefficient, fluctuating equilibria, while the second induces agents to internalize the externality."

A bank note is a perpetual, risky, non-interest-bearing, debt claim with the right to redeem on demand at par in specie. This paper investigates the pricing of this private money taking into account the enormous changes in technology during the period, namely, the introduction and rapid diffusion of the railroad. A contingent claims pricing model for bank notes is proposed and tested using monthly bank note prices for all banks in North America together with indices of the durations and costs of trips back to issuing banks constructed from pre-Civil War travelers' guides. Evidence is produced that market participants properly priced the risks inherent in these securities, suggesting that wildcat banking was not common because of market discipline."

Further, it stresses new results on the robustness of monetary policy rules in which each rule that is optimal or good according to one model or researcher is tested for robustness by other researchers using different models. Because of the large increase in the number of economists focusing on econometric evaluation of monetary policy rules for the interest rate instrument and because of the parallel increase in the variety of models being developed for this purpose, much more evidence is becoming available on the robustness of simple monetary policy rules for the interest rate than ever before."

He illustrates the point by reviewing the Bundesbank's experience with money growth targeting in the mid-1970s. Monetary targeting was a signal that the previous monetary regime had been overcome, and a means to define the role of monetary policy vis-a-vis other players in the macroeconomic policy game, and to structure the internal monetary policy debate."

Real marginal costs are a significant and quantitatively important determinant of inflation. Backward-looking price setting, while statistically significant, is not quantitatively important.

We estimate Phillips curves for prices and unit labour costs in Australia over the past three decades. These Phillips curves allow the NAIRU to change through time, and include a role for import prices and ""speed-limit"" effects. The paper concludes by discussing the changing role of the Phillips curve in the intellectual framework used to analyse inflation within the Reserve Bank of Australia over the past three decades."

We interpret UK Phillips curve dynamics in a positive theory of monetary policy--how policymaker attitudes on the Phillips curve have evolved since the 1950s--rather than, more traditionally, as interaction between exogenous demand and supply disturbances. Combining this framework with reasoned conjectures on how policymakers' beliefs have changed helps explain some features of the evolving UK Phillips curve. We suggest that correlations suggesting an extreme favorable unemployment-inflation tradeoff might indicate not something to be exploited but instead only policymakers' correctly acknowledging that no tradeoff exists."

The starting point is the conventional unemployment rate Phillips curve, which is examined in a simulated out-of-sample forecasting framework. Inflation forecasts produced by the Phillips curve generally have been more accurate than forecasts based on other macroeconomic variables, including interest rates, money and commodity prices. These forecasts can however be improved upon using a generalized Phillips curve based on measures of real aggregate activity other than unemployment, especially a new index of aggregate activity based on 168 economic indicators."

627,"AB: Irreversibility and uncertainty increase the user cost of capital which tends to reduce the capital stock. Working in the opposite direction is a hangover effect, which arises because irreversibility prevents the firm from selling capital even when the marginal revenue product of capital is low. Neither the user cost effect nor the hangover effect dominates globally, so that irreversibility may increase or decrease capital accumulation. Furthermore, an increase in uncertainty can either increase or decrease the long-run capital stock under irreversibility relative to that under reversibility. Other effects that we consider, however, have unambiguous effects on long-run capital accumulation."

This paper focuses on the other side of these transactions--i.e., on the increased production of financial services. I construct a model in which households must make purchases either with money or with costly transactions services produced by firms in the financial services sector. In the model, a higher inflation rate leads households to substitute purchased transactions services for money balances, thereby boosting the size of the financial services sector. A test of the model using cross-sectional data finds that the size of a nation's financial sector is strongly affected by its inflation rate. The empirical results provide an alternative way to measure the costs of inflation. These costs appear to be large."

Rapid inflation induces buyers to speed up purchases, which thus inhibits the selection of more adequate trading partners through search. This blurs distinctions across firms of different productivities and leads to resource misallocations. As inflation causes efficient and inefficient firms to be less distinguishable, the incentives to engage in cost reduction are dampened and lower growth results. The model could provide a rationale for the large number of bankruptcies and large turnover rates following successful inflation stabilization programs, like those of Israel, Bolivia and Argentina."

Common fluctuations have substantial impact on fluctuations in both productivity and investment in these countries, but very little impact on the current account. Country-specific investment fluctuations have a significant negative impact on the current account, while country-specific productivity movements have little independent effect. These findings are shown to be generally consistent with the predictions of a multi-country dynamic model calibrated to the empirical decomposition of productivity shocks."

Technology shocks coupled with the accommodative response of monetary policy to output fluctuations are primarily responsible for the covariation between nominal and real exchange rates. Shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment also play an important role.

The model also identifies an unobserved common cycle that exhibits similar business cycle properties, but smaller seasonal variation, than aggregate payroll employment. The overall industry-level seasonal factors generated by our model do not differ much from univariate X-11 seasonals in sample, but some differences arise in out-of-sample experiments."

Proposed explanations of the smile involve interest rate smoothing by the Fed, time-varying risk premia, ""Peso problems"", and measurement error. We show that despite their highly restrictive nature, some parameterizations of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and Chen-Scott (CS) models of the term structure can account for the predictability smile. CIR and CS parameterizations which are consistent with the smile regularity are inconsistent with other features of the data, however."

The use of this concept in welfare economics relies on the availability of discriminatory lump-sum transfers in such a way that the implementation of the efficient policy measure leads to a Pareto movement in the economy. However, most studies of efficient policies preclude by assumption the existence of lump-sum taxation. This paper proposes, in economies amenable to Gorman aggregation, one simple methodology to rank alternative allocations in terms of their distributional implications, in a world with no lump-sum transfers. This methodology is simple because it is independent of the distribution of characteristics in the economy. Then, for a specific policy measure, it can be easily identified whether it implies an equity-efficiency trade-off. The method is illustrated by analyzing the effects on inequality of the elimination of capital taxation, the reduction of the inflation tax, and the liberalization of capital movements in a small open economy."

In this paper, we develop an approach that provides a solution to these empirical anomalies in an open economy setup. We use a ""structural VAR"" approach with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions and we identify monetary policy shocks by modeling the reaction function of the monetary authorities and the structure of the economy. Our empirical findings are that effects of non-US G-7 monetary policy shocks on exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables are consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. The evidence is consistent with significant, but transitory, real effects of monetary shocks. The ""price"" puzzle is addressed and there is little evidence of open economy anomalies. Specifically, initially the exchange rate appreciates in response to a monetary contraction, but after a few months, the exchange rate depreciates over time in accordance with the uncovered interest parity condition. Overall, our identification scheme gives results that contribute to resolve the empirical anomalies about the effects of monetary policy shocks found in the literature."

Each of these disturbances have different implications for the current account and investment that are largely consistent with the empirical results. First, the current account responds more than investment to country-specific traded productivity growth. Second, global traded productivity and country-specific nontraded productivity growth have no effect on the current account, but they have a significant impact on investment. Third, the global component of nontraded productivity is negligible and has no significant impact on either the current account or investment. In addition, the response of the current account and investment to relative prices (the terms of trade and exchange rate) are insignificant. This paper also discusses the potential reasons for it."

Since inflation and inflation variability tend to be highly correlated, the presence of uncertainty attenuates the negative long-run relationship between inflation and real growth. It also provides a partial rationale for the apparent lack of robustness in cross-country regressions of growth and inflation."

Practically, the two features interact in a positive manner and provide a way to generate significant endogenous persistence."

To explain the observed heterogeneity, I solve a dynamic programming model. When desired production is below the plant's minimum efficient scale, non-convexities induce production bunching, the plant uses less than full capital utilization on average and production is more volatile than sales. When desired production is above the plant's minimum efficient scale, the plant operates in a convex region of the cost curve. In this case, it uses high levels of capital utilization and production is less volatile than sales."

We show that the introduction of this form of sticky prices improves the model's performance at explaining inflation but worsens it for output. The most dramatic failure of the model is the extremely high-frequency fluctuations in output that it generates. Sticky prices not only fail to produce persistent business cycle fluctuations but they generate extreme volatility at very high frequencies."

281,"AB: This paper presents a multisector dynamic general equilibrium model of business cycles with a distinctive feature: aggregate fluctuations are driven by independent sectoral shocks. The model hypothesizes that trade among sectors provides a strong synchronization mechanism for these shocks due to the limited, but locally intense, interaction that is characteristic of such input trade flows. Limited interaction, characterized by a sparse intermediate input-use matrix, reduces substitution possibilities among intermediate inputs which strengthens comovement in sectoral value-added and leads to a postponement of the law of large numbers in the variance of aggregate value-added. The chief virtue of this model is that reliance on implausible aggregate shocks is not necessary to capture the qualitative features of macroeconomic fluctuations. Building on Horvath, 1998, which establishes the theoretical foundation for the relevance of limited interaction in the context of a stylized multisector model, this paper specifies a more general multisector model calibrated to the US 2-digit Standard Industrial Code economy. Simulations prove the model is able to match empirical reality as closely as standard one-sector business cycle models without relying on aggregate shocks."

This paper extends the Solow-Swan growth model allowing for cross-sectional heterogeneity. In this framework, aggregate shocks might vanish at a hyperbolic rather than at an exponential rate. This implies that the level of output can exhibit long memory and that standard tests fail to reject the null of a unit root despite mean reversion. Exploiting secular time series properties of GDP, we conclude that traditional approaches to test for uniform (conditional and unconditional) convergence suit first step approximation. We show both theoretically and empirically how the uniform 2% rate of convergence repeatedly found in the empirical literature is the outcome of an underlying parameter of fractional integration strictly between 1/2 and 1. This is consistent with both time series and cross-sectional evidence recently produced."

First we construct a model with indivisible goods to show conditions under which legal currency is fully acceptable but illegal currency circulates with varying acceptability. We then introduce bargaining to determine prices in legal and illegal currency. We show that some enforcement polices can create multiple equilibria while others will not.

It shows that the price level is indeterminate under a nominal interest rate peg and determinate under a money growth rate peg. Under a feedback rule that sets the nominal interest rate as a non-negative and non-decreasing function of the inflation rate, the price level is indeterminate for both low and high values of the inflation elasticity of the feedback rule and determinate for intermediate values. We also study balanced-budget rules that allow for bounded secondary surpluses or deficits. Comparing our results to those emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level, it becomes clear that a key consideration for price-level determination is whether fiscal policy is specified as an exogenous sequence of primary surpluses/deficits or, alternatively, as an exogenous sequence of secondary surpluses/deficits."

A new experimental setup is used that allows us to observe more details in the process of expectation forming and to separate this process from the actual saving process. In contrast to experimental findings by Lim, Prescott, Sunder, Marimon, Spear, Sunder, and Marimon, Sunder we have found that (1) agents do not form first-order adaptive expectations, (2) subjects ""over-save"" for precautionary reasons, and as a result (3) the so-called Friedman conjecture holds, i.e., monetary policies that are equivalent in static equilibrium exhibit different levels and different volatility with regard to inflation in the experiment. This may generate important policy trade-offs between monetary regimes. We then discuss our findings and relate them to current research on adaptive learning and the role it may have in ranking alternative monetary policies."

404,"AB: We find strong evidence of a stable ""money demand"" relationship for MZM and M2M through the 1990s. Though the M2 relation breaks down somewhere around 1990, evidence has been accumulating that the disturbance is well characterized as a permanent upward shift in M2 velocity, which began around 1990 and was largely over by 1994. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that households permanently reallocated a portion of their wealth from time deposits to mutual funds. Although this reallocation may have been induced by depository restructuring, we argue that the substitution could be explained by appropriately measured opportunity cost."

Adjustment cost in capital accumulation reduces both volatility and the negative correlation in investments on capital goods in the market and at home. Investments commove to the extent that durable goods and time are good substitutes in consumption activities. Consumers substitute durable goods for time at home when the opportunity cost of time is high during booms. Based on the Consumer Expenditure Survey, I show that households' expenditure shares on durable goods are negatively associated with leisure, indicating that durable goods are relatively good substitutes for time."

We first calibrate the model and show that it is capable of generating the observed aggregate fluctuations even when there are no shocks to the fundamentals. In particular, we demonstrate that this model matches the stylized U.S. business cycles facts as well as two more standard models. Then, we find that in this model the scale parameters and the intensity of competition significantly affects the welfare cost of inflation. Specifically, the cost is considerably higher than that in a standard RBC model with competitive markets and constant returns. Moreover, the stronger the increasing returns and the less intense the competition, the higher the welfare costs. These results are confirmed in a number of model specifications."

Balanced budgets have virtually disappeared from the scene. In their place, deficit financing has arisen as an alternative for many countries, becoming a focus of both professional interest and public debate. The current literature has examined this issue by assessing the likelihood that governments violate their intertemporal budget constraint. This paper takes a different tack. We incorporate permanent fiscal deficits into an overlapping generations model and evaluate the implications. We already know that if the steady-state interest rate is less than the growth rate then permanent deficits are indeed sustainable. However, this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. In addition, these deficits and the current stock of debt must also not be ""too big."" We calibrate the model to U.S. data with plausible parameters of taste and technology, derive the theoretical limit to the maximal sustainable deficit implied by this model, and discuss the relevance of our findings for current policy issues."

Additive technology shocks, as well as multiplicative shocks, are introduced and shown to be crucial. Monetary policy is specified as an interest rate targeting rule following developments in the structural vector autoregression (VAR) literature. The interaction between real and nominal rigidities is essential to reproduce the liquidity effect of monetary policy. The model is estimated by maximum likelihood on U.S. data, and its fit is comparable to that of an unrestricted first-order VAR. Besides producing reasonable impulse responses and second moments, this model replicates a feature of U.S. business cycles, never captured by previous research with DSGE models, that an increase in interest rates predicts a decrease in output two to six quarters in the future."

In this paper we show that this wisdom need not hold in a standard model in which fiscal policy is endogenously determined by a maximizing fiscal authority. The claim that fixed rates induce more discipline stresses that sustained adoption of lax fiscal policies must eventually lead to an exhaustion of reserves and thus to a politically costly collapse of the peg. Hence, under fixed rates bad behavior today leads to punishment tomorrow. Under flexible rates bad behavior has costs as well. The difference is in the intertemporal distribution of these costs: flexible rates allow the effects of unsound fiscal policies to manifest themselves immediately through movements in the exchange rate. Hence, bad behavior today leads to punishment today. If fiscal authorities are impatient, flexible rates--by forcing the costs to be paid up-front--provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative private agent. The recent experience of sub-Saharan countries supplies evidence that matches the predictions of the model."

700,"AB: This paper evaluates (1) whether the exogenous component of financial intermediary development influences economic growth and (2) whether cross-country differences in legal and accounting systems (e.g., creditor rights, contract enforcement, and accounting standards) explain differences in the level of financial development. Using both traditional cross-section, instrumental variable procedures and recent dynamic panel techniques, we find that the exogenous components of financial intermediary development is positively associated with economic growth. Also, the data show that cross-country differences in legal and accounting systems help account for differences in financial development. Together, these findings suggest that legal and accounting reforms that strengthen creditor rights, contract enforcement, and accounting practices can boost financial development and accelerate economic growth."

The second is an incentive to free ride: each worker would like others to experiment and reveal information concerning the location of productive jobs.

Cross-sectional comparative advantage between market and non-market sector in the workforce substantially increases the response of aggregate hours to shifts in relative productivity.

The presence of congestion associated with the enforcement of property rights implies that informality can be useful. Whether bureaucratic rent-seeking is detrimental to growth then depends on how good a substitute informality is to production in the formal sector. In order to create profits which can be appropriated, rent-seeking bureaucrats limit entry into the formal economy. As a result, firms operate in the informal sector even when the cost of informality is high, in which case lower growth emerges. However, when the cost of informality is low, a large number of firms choose to operate informally irrespective of entry conditions. In the latter case, growth is unaffected by a rent-seeking bureaucracy as entry restrictions in the formal economy do not bind."

A tradeoff between estimation and control arises because policy actions influence estimation and provide information which may improve future performance. I analyze this tradeoff in a simple model with parameter uncertainty and conduct dynamic simulations of the policymaker's decision problem in the presence of the type of uncertainties that arose in the wake of German reunification. A policy that separates learning from control may induce a persistent upward bias in money growth and inflation, just as observed after unification. In contrast, the optimal learning strategy which exploits the tradeoff between control and estimation significantly improves stabilization performance and reduces the likelihood of inflationary bias."

This paper investigates whether gradual funds rate movements can be explained by the dynamic structure of the economy and the uncertainty surrounding that structure, without recourse to including an ad hoc interest-rate smoothing argument in the Fed's objective function. In the absence of parameter uncertainty, the optimal policy involves more aggressive movements in the funds rate than observed. Parameter uncertainty, however, limits the responsiveness of the interest rate. As a result, the optimal policy under parameter uncertainty can account for a considerable portion of the gradualism observed."

Taking these data imperfections into account, we reassess the evidence on the marginal predictive content of M1 and M2 for real and nominal output. In particular, first by using the latest version of the data that is available, and then using sequences of historical time series that would have been available to forecasters in real-time, we are able to provide a comprehensive assessment of whether money is useful for predicting output. We conclude that the generally significant marginal predictive content of M1 or M2 for output that is found using a recently revised data set is not duplicated in a real-time setting, although M2 is shown to remain useful when 1-year ahead forecasts are constructed using fitted vector autoregressive models."

A bank can use such swaps to temporarily transfer credit risks of their loans to others, reducing the likelihood that defaulting loans trigger the bank's financial distress. Because credit derivatives are more flexible at transferring risks than are other, more established tools, such as loan sales without recourse, these instruments make it easier for banks to circumvent the ""lemons"" problem caused by banks' superior information about the credit quality of their loans. However, we find that the introduction of a credit-derivatives market is not necessarily desirable because it can cause other markets for loan risk-sharing to break down."

Although stabilizing the relative price around its efficient value is one of the appropriate goals of the central bank, stabilizing sticky-price inflation is sufficient for achieving this goal. An optimal monetary policy for a small open economy is also discussed."

To quantify these effects in a model of consumption and portfolio choice, we adopt a semi-parametric projection method for solving dynamic programmes, based on generalized method of moments estimation of the parameters of approximate decision rules.

Under the small-sample distributions generated by the model, the expectations hypothesis is rejected. When we allow moderate time variation in term premiums, the term-premium dynamics interact with peso-problem effects to generate small-sample distributions more consistent with the data.

171,AB: This paper investigates how the choice of timing interval within a standard real business cycle (RBC) model can help resolve two well-known labor-market puzzles. Standard quarterly RBC models have had difficulty replicating certain empirical regularities arising from the US labor market. A weekly version of the RBC model is able to partially resolve these puzzles. The improvement in the performance of the model is due to the interaction between theoretical modifications to the standard RBC model and careful accounting for the sampling properties of US aggregate data.

This paper shows that by carefully tailoring policies in an independent fashion, governments can eliminate price and exchange rate indeterminacy. Specifically, governments are assumed to care about the welfare of their agents so that they never set policy to yield an intertemporal government budget surplus."

We develop a framework to evaluate the gains from a risk management strategy, using these securities to hedge against shocks.

First, U.S. expansionary monetary policy shocks lead to booms in the non-U.S., G-6 countries. In this transmission, changes in trade balance seem to play a minor role while a decrease in the world real interest rate seems important. Second, U.S. expansionary monetary policy shocks worsen the U.S. trade balance in about a year, but subsequently it improves. Overall, the basic versions of Mundell-Flemming-Dornbusch (MFD) and the sticky price (or sticky wage) intertemporal models do not seem to be consistent with the details of the transmission mechanism, and some extended versions seem to be necessary to fit the details."

A durable asset serves as a productive input and as a collateral for loans. The propagation mechanism of a negative productivity shock is enhanced and prolonged through the interaction of credit constraints and asset prices, where the bank loan and the investment are squeezed by a higher bank capital-asset ratio for lending and at the same time, a stricter collateral requirement for borrowing. The model explains why banking crises often coincide with depression in the asset markets. The results also bear policy implications for the debates over regulatory bank capital adequacy and credit control policies."

Our dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model features a vertical input-output structure, with staggered price contracts at each stage of production. Working through the input-output relations and the timing of firms' pricing decisions, the model generates persistent fluctuations in aggregate output and the observed patterns of price dynamics following a monetary shock. Output responses are more persistent, the greater the number of stages of production, and the larger the share of intermediate inputs. With a sufficient number of stages, the persistence is arbitrarily large if the share of intermediate inputs is one at all but finitely many stages."

Formal hypothesis tests detect instability in the estimated parameters, particularly in estimates of the representative household's discount factor. Evidently, more detailed descriptions of the economy are needed to explain movements in interest rates before and after 1979."

We find that the optimal policy is nevertheless an activist countercyclical one. It has the remarkable property that, although the economy is hit each period by stochastic shocks after wages have been preset, this optimal policy will nevertheless succeed in keeping the economy on a full employment track."

I study a model in which the government has a commitment problem in setting taxes that pay for reform. Market expectations about future policy, which determine investment, become fundamental for the reform's success. Reform may be postponed as the government builds credibility with a period of low taxes. Depending on expectations, better equilibria may exist.

All agents solve standard dynamic optimization problems and face strategic complementarity in production, but some solve their inference problems based on simple forecasting rules of thumb. Assuming a hierarchical information structure similar to the one in Townsend's (1983) model of informationally dispersed markets, I show that even a minority of rule-of-thumb forecasters can have a significant effect on the aggregate properties of the economy. For instance, as agents try to forecast each others' behavior they effectively strengthen the internal propagation mechanism of the economy. The quantitative results are obtained by calibrating the model and running a battery of sensitivity tests on key parameters. The analysis highlights the role of strategic complementarity in the heterogeneous expectations literature and precisely quantifies many qualitative claims about the aggregate implications of expectational heterogeneity."

443,"AB: Using a newly constructed data set on Israeli Initial Public Offering (IPO) firms in the 1990s, we study costs and benefits of universal banking. We find that a firm whose equity was underwritten by a bank affiliated underwriter, when the same bank was also a large creditor of the firm in the IPO year, exhibits significantly better than average post-issue accounting performance, but that its stock performance during the first year following the IPO is considerably lower than average. When an investment fund managed by the same bank is heavily involved in the IPO as buyer of the newly issued equity, the stock performance during the first year following the IPO is even lower. This, together with negative first day returns, is indication of IPO overpricing. We interpret these findings as evidence that universal banks use their superior information regarding client firms to float the stock of the ""cherries,"" not the ""lemons"" (as measured by post-issue accounting performance), but that bank managed funds pay too much for bank underwritten IPOs, at the expense of the investors in the funds. These results suggest that there is conflict of interest in the combination of bank lending, underwriting, and fund management."

Oil shocks account for 20-25 percent of the variability in employment growth, twice as much as monetary shocks. The two-year employment response to an oil price increase rises (in magnitude) with capital intensity, energy intensity and product durability. Job destruction shows much greater short-run sensitivity to oil and monetary shocks than job creation except at young, small plants. Employment growth responds asymmetrically to oil price ups and downs, and oil shocks trigger considerable job reallocation activity."

475,"AB: We build a model of emerging markets crises which features two types of collateral constraints. Firms in a domestic economy have limited borrowing capacity from international investors. They also have limited borrowing capacity with respect to each other. We study how the presence and changes in these collateral constraints affect financial and real variables. A binding international constraint in the aggregate leads to a sharp rise in interest rates and fire sales of domestic assets, while limited domestic collateral can lead to wasted international collateral. These two collateral constraints can interact in important ways. The first is disintermediation: a fire sale of domestic assets causes banks to fail in their function of reallocating resources across the economy leading to wasted international collateral. The second is a dynamic effect. We show that firms in an economy with limited domestic collateral and a binding international collateral constraint will not adequately precaution against adverse shocks, increasing the severity of these shocks."

491,"AB: In this paper we document that the disparity in employment densities across US metropolitan areas has lessened substantially over the postwar period. To account for this deconcentration of metropolitan employment, we develop a system-of-cities model in which an increase in aggregate metropolitan employment causes congestion costs to increase faster for the more dense metro areas. A calibrated version of the model reveals that the (roughly) two-and-a-half-fold increase in postwar aggregate metropolitan employment implies, by itself, more deconcentration than actually observed. Thus, rising aggregate metropolitan employment is a powerful force favoring deconcentration, although some benefit of greater employment density appears to have partially offset the effects of rising congestion costs for the more dense metro areas."

508,"AB: I analyze the business cycle implications of noisy economic indicators in the context of a dynamic general equilibrium model. Two main results emerge. First, measurement error in preliminary data releases can have a quantitatively important effect on economic fluctuations. For instance, under efficient signal-extraction, the introduction of accurate economic indicators would make aggregate output 10-30 percent more volatile than suggested by the post-war experience of the U.S. economy. Second, the sign--but not the magnitude--of the measurement error effect depends crucially on the signal processing capabilities of agents. In particular, if agents take the noisy data at face value, significant improvement in the quality of key economic indicators would lead to considerably less cyclical volatility."

We alternatively assume agents can always produce, and simply restrict money inventories to 0 or 1. This seems better for many issues, for example, in the standard model it is difficult to interpret increases in the money supply, because increasing the fraction of agents holding money decreases the economy's productive capacity. Our model avoids these problems and thus delivers more natural, and simpler, implications in many contexts. We compare results on existence, multiplicity, and welfare across models."

The model features two small open economies that face credit constraints and produce a differentiated commodity which they export to a large country. A productivity shock to one of the small open economies triggers an adverse terms of trade shock to the other which is then amplified by credit constraints. The paper provides a new perspective on the relationship between terms of trade shocks and the balance of payments that differs from existing models which focus on risk sharing and consumption smoothing. In particular, it is shown that if financial frictions are present, a temporary terms of trade shock can trigger capital outflows and a rapid deterioration in the current account."

In this paper we first investigate the existence of common cycles in a aggregate data set comprising per-capita output, consumption, and investment. Later we discuss their usefulness in measuring the relative importance of transitory shocks. We show that, taking into account common-cycle restrictions, transitory shocks are more important than previously thought at business-cycle horizons. The central argument relies on efficiency gains from imposing these short-run restrictions on the estimation of the dynamic model. Finally, we discuss how the evidence here and elsewhere can be interpreted to support the view that nominal shocks may be important in the short run."

In contrast to previous studies that analyzed severance payments in frictionless environments, we find that severance payments can have large positive effects on employment and welfare. This result is a consequence of search being costly and of wage contracts being rigid. Moreover, we find that the firing penalty role of severance payments is much more important than their insurance role."

Risk-sharing between households occurs through long-term contracts with intermediaries. We find that incomplete risk-sharing tends to reduce the rate of growth relative to the complete risk-sharing benchmark. Numerical examples indicate that the welfare cost and the growth effect of private information are small.

This paper empirically assesses these predictions. The evidence indicates that there is a significant, and economically important, negative relationship between inflation and both banking sector development and equity market activity. Further, the relationship is nonlinear. As inflation rises, the marginal impact of inflation on banking lending activity and stock market development diminishes rapidly. Moreover, we find evidence of thresholds. For economies with inflation rates exceeding 15 percent, there is a discrete drop in financial sector performance. Finally, while the data indicate that more inflation is not matched by greater nominal equity returns in low-inflation countries, nominal stock returns move essentially one-for-one with marginal increases in inflation in high-inflation economies."

Policy is typically conducted in terms of directives for the nominal interest rate. This paper uses a discrete-time money-in-the-utility function model to demonstrate how seemingly minor modifications in the trading environment result in dramatic differences in the policy restrictions needed to ensure real determinacy. These differences arise because of the differing pricing equations for the nominal interest rate.

We illustrate how the cost of such systems ultimately derives from the credit constraints imposed by RTGS. The effects of these constraints can be undone if the central bank makes intraday credit freely available. If intraday credit is only available on a collateralized basis, however, RTGS will always impose a liquidity cost."

769,"AB: This paper establishes stylized facts about business cycles in the late 19th century, using spectral analysis techniques which allow an intuitive description and analysis of cyclical structure in economic fluctuations. Analysis of industrial production data for 13 countries permits the following generalizations. In the advanced North Atlantic economies, a fairly regular long cycle with a periodicity of 7-10 years is identified in all countries. This component explains a substantial fraction of overall variation in industrial production. There is some evidence of a less regular, less powerful short cycle of 3-5 years duration. In peripheral economies experience is varied, but it is more often the short cycle that exercises greater influence. The long cycle component is shown to be highly correlated among the core economies, much less so between core and peripheral economies, and least of all among peripheral economies. The long cycle is more highly correlated among countries with important trading ties and those on a metallic monetary standard throughout the period."

It extends the linear-quadratic model of output inventories by adding the joint determination of input inventories. Empirically, input inventories are more important than output inventories. Maximum likelihood estimation of the decision rules yields correctly signed and significant parameter estimates using data for nondurable and durable goods industries, but the overidentifying restrictions of the model are rejected. The value added specification dominates because adjustment costs on materials usage are critical to fitting the data."

This result holds also in the presence of intermediated exchange of legal goods. Equilibria with differing transaction patterns and degrees of illicit activities coexist."

8,"AB: This paper develops extensive new indices of legal independence (central bank independence (CBI)) for new central banks (CBs) in 26 former socialist economies. The indices reveal that CB reform in the FSE during the 1990s has been quite ambitious. In spite of large price shocks, reformers in those countries chose to create CBs with levels of legal independence that are substantially higher, on average, than those of developed economies during the 1980s. The evidence in the paper shows that CBI is unrelated to inflation during the early stages of liberalization. But for sufficiently high and sustained levels of liberalization, and controlling for other variables, legal CBI and inflation are significantly and negatively related. These findings are consistent with the view that even high CBI cannot contain the initial powerful inflationary impact of price decontrols. But once the process of liberalization has gathered sufficient momentum legal independence becomes effective in reducing inflation. The paper also presents evidence on factors that affect the choice of CBI and examines the relation between inflation and CBI in a broader sample."

Cross-sectional consumption factors are constructed using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, but they do not appear to be promising candidates for explaining the equity premium. The cross-sectional factors are weakly correlated with stock returns and generate equity premia of 2 percent or less for preference specifications with low degrees of risk aversion."

Using these tools we are able to dissect cycles in terms of the contributions made by trend growth, volatility, serial correlation and non-linear effects.

We use the non-parametric regression method and data on income and tax extracted from U.S. Individual Tax Model Files for the period 1985-95. The flexibility of the non-parametric approach and the information at the individual level enable us to construct a more reliable time series of the average federal marginal income tax rates and that of the average state and local marginal income tax rates. Our results suggest that the average federal marginal income tax rate varies from 18.2% to 21.8%, and the average state and local marginal income tax rate varies from 4.7% to 5.6%. We also find that the state and local income tax accounts for roughly 18% of the total income taxes paid during 1985-95. Moreover, our analysis shows that Stephenson (1998) provides the most consistent tax rate series for use in applications that require estimates of tax rates for years prior to 1985."

A government policy sufficiently favorable to light coins can induce the existence of an equilibrium where both coins circulate and light coins are even accepted at a premium.

It is argued that the two countries' experiences diverged because of the different constraints they faced in financing wartime government expenditures. In the presence of frequent wars, ever-tightening access to foreign capital, and an inadequate tax base, Argentina's use of the inflation tax may be viewed as an optimal solution to its wartime problems. By contrast, with the exception of the Revolutionary War, the absence of such constraints in the United States required full-tax smoothing, with only a temporary use of the inflation tax during wartime. Such policies were embodied in Alexander Hamilton's fiscal package of 1790, which allowed the United States to bond-finance most subsequent wartime expenditures."

224,"AB: A defining stylized fact associated with exchange-rate-based stabilization programs is that their initial phase is characterized by several years of continuous expansion in private consumption and a gradual appreciation of the real exchange rate. This paper shows that a large class of standard optimizing models is unable to account for this empirical regularity. In particular, models in this class predict that a gradual appreciation of the real exchange rate must necessarily be accompanied by a declining path of consumption. The paper suggests several possible solutions to this problem and develops one in detail. Namely, the relaxation of the assumption of time separability in preferences. Specifically, it shows that under habit formation currency pegs induce a positive comovement between consumption and the real exchange rate. The paper also establishes that habit formation provides an explanation for why in failed currency pegs a contraction in aggregate demand sets in before the collapse of the program."

The subjects of study are Germany and France. In France, macroeconomic volatility under EMU is comparable to that under a flexible exchange rate system but considerably lower than that under EMS. In Germany, output volatility is significantly higher under EMS--relative to the flexible regime--and increases even further under EMU. Inflation, though, becomes more stable. EMU also induces a strong negative international transmission of country specific supply shocks and amplifies their role. This fact may complicate ECB policymaking."

While sticky-price exchange-rate theories predict a relationship, empirical evidence on the hypothesized link has proved elusive. Our conjecture is that the empirical difficulty is due to a failure to recognize nonlinearity in real exchange rate adjustment. When we introduce threshold nonlinearity into a traditional model to take account of a transaction cost-induced ""band of inaction"" for price adjustment, only outside the band will the real exchange rate exhibit mean reversion and bear an association with real interest differentials. Our estimated nonlinear models provide evidence supporting this view."

The sticky price model is invariant to changes in money demands. However, the limited participation model predicts the effect of a money shock on output rose by 100 percent between 1952 and 1980, and subsequently fell 65 percent. This prediction is hard to reconcile with evidence that suggests the effects of monetary shocks are stable over time, and suggests that goods market imperfections, rather than asset market imperfections, may be the driving force behind postwar U.S. monetary nonneutrality."

The standard optimizing IS-LM model cannot account for this result, but I show that it can once the long-term nominal interest rate is included in the money demand function. Because the long-term real rate matters for aggregate demand, the presence of the long-term nominal rate in the money demand function increases the effect of nominal money stock changes on real aggregate demand when prices are sticky."

For example, if the payoff on an asset becomes riskier in the sense of second-degree stochastic dominance, the equilibrium price of the asset need not necessarily fall. We further demonstrate how our results can be imbedded into a market that is incomplete in the sense of containing an uninsurable background risk, such as a risk on labor income.

A survey is used to decompose the CPI into freely determined and regulated sub-components. Evidence is provided that prices in the regulated sector of the economy respond approximately two quarters after prices in the freely determined sector, thereby contributing a source of stickiness in overall inflation and in the response of inflation to monetary policy."

Using enterprise-level data, we find that there were big differences in the magnitude of the credit contraction across different types of firms. In particular, chaebol (conglomerate)-affiliated firms appeared to have lost the preferential access to credit that they had enjoyed in the pre-crisis period, and credit appears to have been reallocated in favor of more efficient firms. This suggests that the credit crunch suffered by certain sectors can be attributed to the adjustment by banks and enterprises to the restructuring of the financial sector, rather than tight monetary policy or an external credit constraint."

Gains from cooperation arise, however, that stem from the impact of foreign economic activity on the domestic marginal cost of production. While under Nash central banks need only adjust the interest rate in response to domestic inflation, under cooperation they should respond to foreign inflation as well.

Exchange rates may be highly volatile because in a sense they have little effect on macroeconomic variables. The paper shows the ingredients necessary to construct such an explanation for exchange rate volatility. In addition to the presence of local currency pricing, we need (a) incomplete international financial markets, (b) a structure of international pricing and product distribution such that wealth effects of exchange rate changes are minimized, and (c) stochastic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity. Together, it is shown that these elements can produce exchange rate volatility that is much higher than shocks to economic fundamentals, and ""disconnected"" from the rest of the economy in the sense that the volatility of all other macroeconomic aggregates are of the same order as that of fundamentals."

The degree of domestic and import price stickiness is estimated by reproducing the empirical identified impulse response of a monetary policy and exchange rate shock conditional on the response of output, net trade and the exchange rate. It is shown that a central bank that wants to minimise the resource costs of staggered price setting will aim at minimising a weighted average of domestic and import price inflation."

Optimized policy rules have a pronounced anti-inflation stance and entail significant nominal and real exchange rate volatility. The country responds to an increase in external volatility by holding more foreign assets. The policy rule affects the variance and the mean of consumption. The effect on the mean matters significantly for welfare."

We develop an optimizing model to account for why public news should increase the price impact of trades. Using transaction data made available by electronic trading, we test whether trades following macroeconomic news have higher price impact. They do: price impact per dollar traded is about 10 percent higher per news announcement in the previous hour. After controlling for public information flow, we do not find evidence that liquidity depends on trading volume and return volatility. The findings provide policy makers with guidance for the timing and magnitude intervention."

The nominal exchange rate exhibits a unit root. Under flexible prices, it also depends on the stock of real net foreign assets. With sticky prices, the exchange rate depends on the past GDP differential, along with net foreign assets. Endogenous monetary policy and asset dynamics have consequences for exchange rate overshooting. A persistent relative productivity shock results in delayed overshooting under both flexible and sticky prices. A persistent relative interest rate shock generates undershooting under flexible prices."

The conventional wisdom asserts that this gradual adjustment reflects a policy inertia or interest rate smoothing behavior by central banks. However, such quarterly monetary policy inertia would imply a large amount of forecastable variation in interest rates at horizons of more than 3 months, which is contradicted by evidence from the term structure of interest rates. The illusion of monetary policy inertia evident in the estimated policy rules likely reflects the persistent shocks that central banks face."

695,"AB: This paper undertakes a simple general equilibrium analysis of the consequences of deposit insurance programs, the way in which they are priced, and the way in which they fund revenue shortfalls. In our economy, the central issue in analyzing deposit insurance is how the government will make up any FDIC losses. Deposit insurance premia matter only in so far as they affect the level of implied FDIC revenue shortfalls. Moreover, local variations in the magnitude of FDIC losses will generically be irrelevant for the determination of any equilibrium quantities that affect agent welfare. However, large enough changes in these losses can ""matter."" There is no presumption that keeping these shortfalls low is a ""good idea."" Finally, we show that multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria can be observed. The potential for multiplicity of equilibria may depend on components of FDIC policy. Our analysis provides counterexamples to the following propositions. (1) Actuarially fair pricing of deposit insurance is always desirable. (2) Implicit FDIC subsidization of banks through deposit insurance is always undesirable. (3) ""Large"" FDIC losses are necessarily symptomatic of a poorly designed deposit insurance system. (4) Risk-based deposit insurance premia can easily be used to reduce moral hazard problems associated with deposit insurance provision."

While agents with time-separable preferences care only about the overall volatility of consumption, we show that agents with habit preferences care not only about overall volatility, but also about the temporal distribution of that volatility. Specifically, habit agents are much more averse to high-frequency fluctuations than to low-frequency fluctuations. In fact, the size of the equity premium in the habit model is determined by a relatively insignificant amount of high-frequency volatility in U.S. consumption."

Such findings provide a novel and powerful explanation for the observed strong correlation between seasonal fluctuations and business cycles.

Despite the fact that players are assumed to be unsophisticated, and follow simple adaptive rules, we observe steady states with widespread lending. The game also has steady states with no borrowing or lending, and these can persist in the long run. Using a mix of analytical and computational methods, we identify stable outcomes and provide an explanation for our results.

We examine the attitude towards risk on initial wealth when the agent allocate this wealth to consumption over his lifetime. Time diversification occurs in that case because the agent will optimally split the risk on wealth into small, seemingly independent, risks on consumption. The introduction of liquidity constraints reduces the implicit time horizon of the consumer and thereby increases his risk aversion. The negative relationship between initial wealth and the implicit time horizon where the consumer will be liquidity constrained provides an argument for decreasing aversion to risk on wealth."

The model includes the main housing tax provisions currently in place in the U.S. and a minimum downpayment requirement upon purchasing non-divisible houses. The tax code makes the return on housing capital larger than that on business capital, which distorts the lifetime profile and composition of individuals' savings. The wedge between the two rates of return emanates from the failure to tax imputed rents and is amplified by the presence of mortgage interest deductibility.

We find that a monetary policy shock, introduced by raising the overnight rate the Bank of Israel charges member banks, raises real interest rates but lowers inflation expectations. Long-term real interest rates are less impacted than short-term rates. Lastly, monetary shocks affect the exchange rate between the Israeli currency and the US dollar. Our estimates are robust to numerous modifications to the basic VAR model."

This paper explores the quantitative implications of one propagation mechanism: learning-by-doing, whose parameters are estimated using sectoral and plant level observations in the U.S. which are then integrated into a stochastic growth model with technology shocks. We conclude that learning-by-doing can be a powerful mechanism for generating endogenous persistence. Moreover learning-by-doing implies that the employment decision of the representative agent is dynamic which allows a re-interpretation of ""taste shocks"" or ""cyclical labor utilization"" as endogenous labor supply shifts."

Over 40 billion dollars of unsecured debt were discharged in 1998 by 1.44 million households. These losses have led legislators to propose a variety of changes in bankruptcy law, the most important and recent of which is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 (BA99). I develop a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model of personal bankruptcy to investigate the trade-off between the consumption smoothing role of bankruptcy and the interest rate and deadweight costs it imposes. I find that stringent means-tests would reduce filing rates only slightly, and would have only modest welfare consequences. On the other hand, the elimination of bankruptcy altogether is found to have substantial benefits. This result is robust to income shock persistence, and to stringency in the application of means-tests."

Our framework potentially generates three types of inefficiencies: the no-trade inefficiency, where no trade takes place even though it would be socially efficient to trade, and the too-much-trade and too-little-trade inefficiencies, where the quantities produced and exchanged are either larger or smaller than what the solution to a social planner's problem would mandate. It is shown that while the no-trade and the too-much-trade inefficiencies are caused by the indivisibility of money, the too-little-trade inefficiency remains even when money is divisible unless it is sufficiently valued."

It follows that a large fraction of the movement in the cost of capital in standard investment models must be attributable to movements in equity risk-premia. In this paper we emphasize that such movements in equity risk premia should have implications not merely for investment today, but also for future investment over long horizons. In this case, predictive variables for excess stock returns over long-horizons are also likely to forecast long-horizon fluctuations in the growth of marginal Q, and therefore investment. We test this implication directly by performing long-horizon forecasting regressions of aggregate investment growth using a variety of predictive variables shown elsewhere to have forecasting power for excess stock market returns."

The first set of shocks are the ones whose primary impact lies in the future. These shocks affect the economy and asset prices through expectations of future growth. The second set are shocks to net worth which directly impact the ability of firms to borrow and for consumers to lend.

That is, their attitude toward consumption in the long run is a standard one--they do place zero weight on consumption far enough out in the future--but their short-run effective rates of discount may be negative. Our model, which is an elaboration on the framework proposed by Faruk Gul and Wolfgang Pesendorfer, does not feature time inconsistencies. Thus, we view consumers as fully rational, but subject to specific ""internal frictions"" in the form of temptation and self-control problems. The model nests the Mehra-Prescott model and we use it as a way of interpreting the wealth and asset pricing data. Some aspects of these data, we argue, can possibly be better understood using our model than the standard one."

We argue that limited attention and overconfidence cause investor credulity about the strategic incentives of informed market participants. However, individuals as political participants remain subject to the biases and self-interest they exhibit in private settings. Indeed, correcting contemporaneous market pricing errors is probably not government's relative advantage. Government and private planners should establish rules ex ante to improve choices and efficiency, including disclosure, reporting, advertising, and default-option-setting regulations. Especially, government should avoid actions that exacerbate investor biases."

1093,"AB: The recent increase in interest in so-called behavioral models of asset-pricing is motivated partly by the desire to have models that appear realistic in light of experimental evidence, and partly by their success in moment-matching exercises. This paper argues that the attention given to these two criteria misses perhaps the most important aspect of the modeling exercises. That is, the search for parameters that are invariant to changes in the economic environment. It is precisely this invariance that motivates the use of a tightly parameterized general equilibrium model. Assessing a model on this dimension is difficult and, as the paper argues through the use of suggestive examples, will undoubtedly require strong subjective judgments about the reasonableness of preference assumptions. Such judgments are routinely made about the reasonableness of assumptions about stochastic endowments. The paper suggests that more effort be applied to understanding aggregation in these models and to the exploration of behavioral assumptions in a less flexible but less corruptible time-stationary recursive class of preferences."

In this paper, we show that such rules may perform very poorly in the more general case in which non-nested models represent competing perspectives about controversial issues such as expectations formation and inflation persistence. Using Bayesian and minimax strategies, we then consider whether any simple rule can provide robust performance across such divergent representations of the economy. We find that a robust outcome is attainable only in cases where the objective function places substantial weight on stabilizing both output and inflation, in contrast, we are unable to find a robust policy rule when the sole policy objective is to stabilize inflation. We analyze these results using a new diagnostic approach, namely, by quantifying the fault tolerance of each model economy with respect to deviations from optimal policy."

40,"AB: This study examines the usefulness of the Taylor-rule framework as an organizing device for describing the policy debate and evolution of monetary policy in the United States. Monetary policy during the 1920s and since the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord can be broadly interpreted in terms of this framework with rather surprising consistency. In broad terms, during these periods policy has been generally formulated in a forward-looking manner with price stability and economic stability serving as implicit or explicit guides. As early as the 1920s, measures of real economic activity relative to ""normal"" or ""potential"" supply appear to have influenced policy analysis and deliberations. Confidence in such measures as guides for activist monetary policy proved counterproductive at times, resulting in excessive activism, such as during the Great Inflation and at the brink of the Great Depression. Policy during the past two decades is broadly consistent with natural growth targeting variants of the Taylor rule that exhibit less activism."

75,"AB: This paper considers the role of monetary aggregates in modern macroeconomic models of the New Keynesian type. The focus is on future model developments that are suggested by the monetarist literature, and that in addition seem justified empirically. Both the relation between money and inflation, and between money and aggregate demand, are considered. Regarding the first relation, it is argued that both the mean and the dynamics of inflation in present-day models are governed by money growth. This arises from a conventional aggregate-demand channel, claims that an emphasis on the link between monetary aggregates and inflation requires a direct channel connecting money to inflation, are wide of the mark. The relevance of money for aggregate demand, in turn, comes not via real balance effects (or other justifications for money in the IS equation), but on money serving as a proxy for the various substitution effects of monetary policy that exist when many asset prices matter for aggregate demand. This role for monetary aggregates is supported by empirical evidence and enhances the value of money to monetary policy."

Our analysis is based on an estimated model of Japan, the United States and the euro area with rational expectations and nominal rigidities. First, we provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of the zero bound on the effectiveness of interest rate policy in Japan in terms of stabilizing output and inflation. Then we evaluate three concrete proposals that focus on depreciation of the currency as a way to ameliorate the effect of the zero bound and evade a potential liquidity trap. Finally, we investigate the international consequences of these proposals."

174,"AB: A sizeable fraction of recent research on monetary policy has been concerned with issues relating to analytical ""indeterminacies""--i.e. multiple solutions in rational expectations (RE) models. Most of the literature features sophisticated RE analysis conducted within dynamic models that reflect optimizing behavior by individual agents and incorporate Taylor-style policy rules. A few papers have suggested that some of the particular indeterminacy arguments are misleading or irrelevant. For the most part, however, there has been little dissent from the position that these indeterminacies present a genuine problem for monetary policy makers. The purpose of the present paper, by contrast, is to argue that conclusions based on multiple-solution indeterminacy findings are of dubious merit rather generally."

Or do they simply reflect the particular way that monetary policymakers react to developments in the real economy? To answer these questions, this paper uses maximum likelihood to estimate a model of endogenous money. This model allows, but does not require, nominal prices to be sticky. The results show that nominal price rigidity, over and above endogenous money, plays a role in accounting for key features of the data."

In contrast, the Eurosystem's money-growth indicator (the difference between nominal money growth and a reference value), the prominent ""first pillar"" in its monetary strategy, contains little information about future inflation, and no information beyond that contained in the output and real money gaps. The predictive performance of the output gap has improved compared to that in a previous version of this paper, most likely because of better estimation methods."

Applied to an econometric model of U.S. monetary policy, we find that a rich class of interventions routinely considered by the Federal Reserve is modest and their impacts can be reliably forecasted by an identified linear model.

It is thus natural to compare education to other tax-transfer schemes designed to achieve distributional objectives. While equity-efficiency trade-offs are frequently discussed, they are rarely explicitly treated. This paper creates a general equilibrium model of school attendance, labor supply, wage determination, and aggregate production, which is used to compare alternative redistribution devices in terms of both deadweight loss and distributional outcomes. A wage subsidy generally dominates tuition subsidies across a wide range of fundamental parameters for the economy. Both are generally superior to a negative income tax. With externalities in production, however, there is an unambiguous role for governmental subsidy of education, because it both raises GDP and creates a more equal income distribution."

The paper shows that commodity money can be inflated similarly to fiat money through repeated debasements, which act like devaluations. Furthermore, as with fiat money, demand for commodity money falls with inflation. However, at high rates of inflation demand for commodity money becomes insensitive to inflation, since commodity money has intrinsic value in addition to its transactions value. Finally, we show that anticipated stabilization reduces demand for commodity money."

327,"AB: In a seminal paper, Davis and Haltiwanger (1990) demonstrated that recessions are associated with increased job reallocation. The conventional view has interpreted this as evidence of ""cleansing"": less productive jobs are destroyed in recessions, and resources are reallocated to more productive uses. This paper argues instead that in the presence of credit market frictions, reallocation might go the other way, directing resources from more efficient to less efficient uses. This will occur if more efficient production arrangements are also more vulnerable to credit constraints. I show that this pattern arises endogenously in an equilibrium model, and offer some evidence that firms with higher output per worker tend to borrow more, suggesting they are more vulnerable to credit constrains."

363,AB: This paper studies optimal monetary policy in a model where inflation is persistent. Two types of price setters are assumed to exist. One acts rationally given Calvo-type constraints on price setting. The other type sets prices according to a rule-of-thumb. This results in a Phillips curve with both a forward-looking term and a backward-looking term. The Phillips curve nests a standard purely forward-looking Phillips curve as well as a standard purely backward-looking Phillips curve as special cases. A cost push supply shock is derived from microfoundations by adding a time varying income tax and by making the elasticity of substitution between goods stochastic. A central bank loss function for this model is derived from a second-order Taylor approximation of the household's welfare function. Optimal monetary policy for different relative values of the forward- and backward-looking terms is then analyzed for both the commitment case and the case of discretion.

379,AB: We formulate a consumption-based asset pricing model in which aggregate risk aversion is time-varying in response to both news about consumption growth (as in a habit formation model) and news about inflation. We estimate our model and explore its pricing implications for the term structure of interest rates and the cross-section of stock returns. Our empirical results support the hypothesis that aggregate risk aversion varies in response to news about inflation. The induced time-variation in risk aversion does not appear to proxy for inflation uncertainty or economic growth.

397,"AB: We estimate output growth rate spectra for 58 countries. The spectra exhibit diverse shapes. To study the sources of this diversity, we estimate the short-run, business cycle, and long-run frequency components of the sampled series. For most OECD countries the bulk of the spectral mass is in the business cycle frequency band, and the magnitude of this cyclical component increases with income. For the developing countries, however, the spectral mass is not concentrated in the business cycle frequency band, and the income-cycle relationship is not as strong. We also estimate two frequency domain measures of shock persistence and find both measures to vary considerably across countries, with the U.S. having the lowest estimates. For the OECD countries most of the variation in the variance ratio statistic appears to be explained by the variation in the long-term growth component."

Our model allows agents to use any currency to trade for goods in all countries. However, search frictions restrict agents' opportunities for instantaneous arbitrage, and hence make the nominal exchange rate determinate. The nominal exchange rate depends on the two countries' economic fundamentals, including the stocks and growth rates of the two monies. Direct exchanges between currencies are essential and they imply a nominal exchange rate that is different from the relative price between the two currencies in the goods markets. There are persistent violations of the law of one price and purchasing power parity in equilibrium, despite the fact that prices are perfectly flexible and all goods are tradeable between countries. Nominal and real exchange rates can move together in the steady state in response to money growth shocks."

510,"AB: Countries that have pursued distortionary macroeconomic policies, including high inflation, large budget deficits and misaligned exchange rates, appear to have suffered more macroeconomic volatility and also grown more slowly during the postwar period. Does this reflect the causal effect of these macroeconomic policies on economic outcomes? One reason to suspect that the answer may be no is that countries pursuing poor macroeconomic policies also have weak ""institutions,"" including political institutions that do not constrain politicians and political elites, ineffective enforcement of property rights for investors, widespread corruption, and a high degree of political instability. This paper documents that countries that inherited more ""extractive"" institutions from their colonial past were more likely to experience high volatility and economic crises during the postwar period. More specifically, societies where European colonists faced high mortality rates more than 100 years ago are much more volatile and prone to crises. Based on our previous work, we interpret this relationship as due to the causal effect of institutions on economic outcomes: Europeans did not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions in areas where they faced high mortality. Once we control for the effect of institutions, macroeconomic policies appear to have only a minor impact on volatility and crises. This suggests that distortionary macroeconomic policies are more likely to be symptoms of underlying institutional problems rather than the main causes of economic volatility, and also that the effects of institutional differences on volatility do not appear to be primarily mediated by any of the standard macroeconomic variables. Instead, it appears that weak institutions cause volatility through a number of microeconomic, as well as macroeconomic, channels."

These three stylized facts have been documented extensively. Here we investigate the partial effects of institutions and trade on growth. We argue that cross-country regressions of the log-level of per capita GDP on instrumented measures of trade and institutional quality are uninformative about the relative importance of trade and institutions in the long run, because of the very high correlation between the latter two variables. In contrast, regressions of changes in decadal growth rates on instrumented changes in trade and changes in institutional quality provide evidence of a significant effect of trade on growth, with a smaller role for improvements in institutions. These results are suggestive of an important joint role for both trade and institutions in the very long run, but a relatively larger role for trade over shorter horizons."

Each trade between two members of a community has the structure of the prisoners' dilemma. Trades are repeated indefinitely, but not necessarily each period. Social capital is defined as the social structure which facilitates cooperative trade as an equilibrium. The trading model is incorporated into a growth model to explore the connections between growth, labor mobility, and social capital. The key assumption is that technological innovation, which drives growth, involves a reallocation of labor that affects social capital. Modifying the responsiveness of labor to a technological shock, has implications for both labor efficiency and social capital."

601,"AB: In many countries, the operation of legal, political and regulatory institutions is subverted by the wealthy and the politically powerful for their own benefit. This subversion takes the form of corruption, intimidation, and other forms of influence. We present a model of such institutional subversion--focusing specifically on courts--and of the effects of inequality in economic and political resources on the magnitude of subversion. We then use the model to analyze the consequences of institutional subversion for the law and order environment in the country, as well as for capital accumulation and growth. We illustrate the model with historical evidence from Gilded Age United States and the transition economies of the 1990s. We also present some cross-country evidence consistent with the basic prediction of the model."

633,"AB: Since Max Weber, there has been an active debate on the impact of religion on people's economic attitudes. Much of the existing evidence, however, is based on cross-country studies in which this impact is confounded by differences in other institutional factors. We use the World Values Surveys to identify the relationship between intensity of religious beliefs and economic attitudes, controlling for country-fixed effects. We study several economic attitudes toward cooperation, the government, working women, legal rules, thriftiness, and the market economy. We also distinguish across religious denominations, differentiating on whether a religion is dominant in a country. We find that on average, religious beliefs are associated with ""good"" economic attitudes, where ""good"" is defined as conducive to higher per capita income and growth. Yet religious people tend to be more racist and less favorable with respect to working women. These effects differ across religious denominations. Overall, we find that Christian religions are more positively associated with attitudes conducive to economic growth."

664,"AB: This paper proposes a low cost alternative to the large bailout packages that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has organized to address financial crises. The IMF would act as a lender of last resort. Faced with an unsustainable debt burden, a government would declare default. It would announce negotiations to restructure its debt at a sustainable level and a minimum restructured value of the debt. During the restructuring period, the IMF would provide a cash support bid at a discount to the government's minimum offer. The IMF floor would guarantee liquidity and create a functioning market in the defaulted debt. The proposal would remedy market failure, preclude panic and contagion, and facilitate an orderly debt restructuring. This would be achieved without substantial official funds. Lenders would be forced to bear the risks they undertake thereby reducing moral hazard and future instability."

We find that, while such costs lead to nontrivial nonlinearities in aggregate investment demand, equilibrium investment is effectively unchanged. Our finding, based on a model in which aggregate fluctuations arise through exogenous changes in total factor productivity, is robust to the introduction of shocks to the relative price of investment goods."

The conference was motivated by the convergence of lines of research in monetary and banking theory that are focused on the institutional arrangements that facilitate exchange. At the same time, central bank policymakers concerned about the efficiency implications of their involvement in and regulation of clearing and settlement arrangements increasingly seek an economic understanding of these activities. It appears that a distinct and coherent field of inquiry is emerging, focused on the mechanics of exchange. This field, which we call payment economics, studies both the instruments agents use to make payments and the central role of bank intermediation in facilitating the use of private liabilities in exchange."

We isolate conditions under which a combination of inside and outside money does and does not allow the economy to achieve a first-best allocation of resources.

We test the model with data from the largest banks in the Swiss Interbank Clearing system. We find that the turnover ratio (the speed with which a bank turns over its reserves in the payment system) depends largely on the aggregate value of its payments.

Most had a large, highly stable relationship with a single correspondent bank. The location of a country bank's correspondent was consistent with trade patterns, particularly railroad and canal linkages. Philadelphia banks, in contrast, did not establish correspondent-type banking relationships. Further, Philadelphia's correspondent banking market was not highly concentrated, and entry was easy."

A private clearinghouse arrangement improves efficiency but produces a real indeterminacy. The pricing of daylight overdrafts is irrelevant for the equilibrium allocation. Efficiency is achieved with a zero nominal interest rate on overnight central bank lending, or through private overnight interbank lending."

In our model, a central bank sets the interest rate equal to its current estimate of the so-called Wicksellian natural rate of interest. This is shown to imply that the interest rate responds to the central bank's estimates of both current inflation and output gap, as advocated by Taylor (1993). It is also shown that the noise contained in the indicators justifies a degree of policy cautiousness. A reduced-form representation of optimal policy should exhibit interest-rate smoothing, which is often found in the empirical literature on monetary policy reaction functions."

854,"AB: Most empirical analyses of monetary policy have been confined to frameworks in which the Federal Reserve is implicitly assumed to exploit only a limited amount of information, despite the fact that the Fed actively monitors literally thousands of economic time series. This article explores the feasibility of incorporating richer information sets into the analysis, both positive and normative, of Fed policymaking. We employ a factor-model approach, developed by Stock, J. H., Watson, M. W., Diffusion Indices, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 2002, 20 (2) 147, Forecasting Inflation, 1999, Journal of Monetary Economics 44 (2) 293, that permits the systematic information in large data sets to be summarized by relatively few estimated factors. With this framework, we reconfirm Stock and Watson's result that the use of large data sets can improve forecast accuracy, and we show that this result does not seem to depend on the use of finally revised (as opposed to ""real-time"") data. We estimate policy reaction functions for the Fed that take into account its data-rich environment and provide a test of the hypothesis that Fed actions are explained solely by its forecasts of inflation and real activity. Finally, we explore the possibility of developing an ""expert system"" that could aggregate diverse information and provide benchmark policy settings."

888,"AB: This paper shows how to formulate and compute robust Ramsey (aka Stackelberg) plans for linear models with forward-looking private agents. The leader and the followers share a common approximating model and both have preferences for robust decision rules because both doubt the model. Since their preferences differ, the leader's and followers' decision rules are fragile to different misspecifications of the approximating model. We define a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust decision makers in which the leader and follower have different worst-case models despite sharing a common approximating model. To compute a Stackelberg equilibrium we formulate a Bellman equation that is associated with an artificial single-agent robust control problem. The artificial Bellman equation contains a description of implementability constraints that include Euler equations that describe the worst-case analysis of the followers. As an example, the paper analyzes a model of a monopoly facing a competitive fringe."

903,"AB: This study investigates the implications of noisy information regarding the measurement of economic activity for the evaluation of monetary policy. Using a simple model of the U.S. economy, I show that failing to account for the actual level of information noise in the historical data provides a seriously distorted picture of feasible macroeconomic outcomes and produces inefficient policy rules. Naive adoption of policies identified as efficient when this difficulty is ignored results in macroeconomic performance worse than actual experience. When the noise content of the data is properly taken into account, policy reactions are cautious and less sensitive to the apparent imbalances in the unfiltered data. The resulting policy prescriptions reflect the recognition that excessively activist policy can increase rather than decrease economic instability."

920,"AB: In recent years, activist monetary policy rules responding to inflation and the level of economic activity have been advanced as a means of achieving effective output stabilization without inflation. Advocates of such policies suggest that their flexibility may yield substantial stabilization benefits while avoiding the excesses of overzealous discretionary fine-tuning such as is thought to characterize the experience of the 1960s and 1970s. In this study I present evidence suggesting that these conclusions are misguided. Using an estimated model, I show that when informational limitations are properly accounted for, activist policies would not have averted the Great Inflation but instead would have resulted in worse macroeconomic performance than the actual historical experience. The problem can be attributed, in large part, to the counterproductive reliance of these policies on the output gap. The analysis suggests that the dismal economic outcomes of the Great Inflation may have resulted from an unfortunate pursuit of activist policies in the face of bad measurement, specifically, overoptimistic assessments of the output gap associated with the productivity slowdown of the late 1960s and early 1970s."

Second, we evaluate the extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the optimal one) in the context of a standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the economy (as well as the Fed's) to a technology shock. Second, the Fed's response to a technology shock in the Volcker-Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the Pre-Volcker period the Fed's policy tended to overstabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation volatility. Our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting an improvement in the Fed's performance."

Using a term structure model with inflation and economic growth factors, together with latent variables, we investigate how macro variables affect bond prices and the dynamics of the yield curve. We find that the forecasting performance of a VAR improves when no-arbitrage restrictions are imposed and that models with macro factors forecast better than models with only unobservable factors. Variance decompositions show that macro factors explain up to 85% of the variation in bond yields. Macro factors primarily explain movements at the short end and middle of the yield curve while unobservable factors still account for most of the movement at the long end of the yield curve."

Instead, this advantage is generated by confidential supervisory knowledge about troubled, non-publicly traded institutions. As a result, this information can remain confidential for an extended period, since these banks have neither the desire to fully disclose the extent of their financial troubles, nor the requirement to do so. The informational advantage is both statistically significant and economically important, providing a potential justification for activist monetary policy."

However, there is very little evidence that the behavior of other macroeconomic variables varies systematically with the exchange rate regime. This paper seeks to resolve this puzzle. We examine the effects of the exchange rate regime in a dynamic general equilibrium model with nominal goods prices set in the buyer's currency and incomplete asset markets. The model predicts a sharp increase in the volatility of the real exchange rate when moving from pegged to floating rates, while this pattern is not observed for other variables. The model also predicts a higher comovement of variables across countries under fixed rather than under flexible rates, a prediction that accords with recent empirical studies."

We document that distribution costs are very large for the average consumer good: they represent more than 40% of the retail price in the US and roughly 60% of the retail price in Argentina. Distribution services require local labor and land so they drive a natural wedge between retail prices in different countries. We show that introducing a distribution sector in an otherwise standard model of exchange-rate-based stabilizations dramatically improves its ability to rationalize observed real exchange rate dynamics.

We considered two models which allow forecasting based on large panels of time series: Forni et al. (Rev. Econom. Statist. 82 (2000) 540, Mimeo (2001b)) and Stock and Watson (Mimeo (1999)). Performance of both models were compared to that of a simple univariate AR model.

We find that financial variables do help forecasting inflation, but do not help forecasting industrial production."

First, the optimal policy horizon for a price level objective is generally longer than that for an inflation objective. Second, the policy horizon becomes longer, the greater the weight on other objectives like minimising output gap and interest rate variability. Third, the optimal policy horizon is shorter, the higher the degree of ""forward-lookingness"" in the economy and the greater the slope of the Phillips curve. Finally, even if society cares only about inflation stabilisation, it often pays to give the central bank a price level objective, provided the horizon is optimally chosen to be somewhat longer."

As risk increases, agents increasingly use the safe currency as a medium of exchange--dollarization occurs. Furthermore, the safe currency trades for multiple units of the risky currency. This type of currency exchange, and the corresponding nominal exchange rate, are often observed in black market or unofficial currency exchange markets in developing countries. Due to decentralized trading, a distribution of exchange rates arises, whose mean and variance change in predictable ways when currency risk increases."

25,"AB: This paper explains why relative PPP should hold more tightly in emerging markets, and why pricing to market would be observed more frequently in the OECD countries. It studies the endogenous determination of pricing to market, in a real option model with time-dependent transportation costs, where the future terms of trade are random. Allowing time-dependent transportation costs adds a dimension of investment to the pre-buying of imports, implying that financial considerations determine the frequency of pricing to market, and the deviations from relative PPP. If the expected discounted cost of last minute delivery is higher than pre-buying, one exercises the option of spot market imports if the realized terms of trade are favorable enough. Pricing to market is observed in countries characterized by low terms of trade volatility and low financing costs. In these circumstances, imports are pre-bought, and the spot market for imports is inactive. In countries where the financing costs and the terms of trade volatility are high, few imports are pre-bought, the price of imports is determined by the realized real exchange rate, and a version of relative PPP holds. With an intermediate level of terms of trade volatility and of financing costs, a mixed regime is observed. If the realized real exchange rate is weak, pricing to market would prevail, increasing consumers' welfare by shielding them from the adverse purchasing power consequences of weak terms of trade. If the realized real exchange rate is favorable enough, more imports are purchased in the spot market, and the relative PPP would hold. Higher financing costs increase the cost of pre-buying imports, reducing thereby the frequency of pricing to market, increasing the expected relative price of imports, reducing the expected deviations from relative PPP, and reducing welfare."

The non-cooperative equilibrium may be suboptimal because of terms of trade spillover effects, while monetary union may be suboptimal because of the sluggishness of relative prices.

First, we endogenize the output process within a more general multi-equation framework, capturing the dynamic feedback between output and various smoothing channels. Second, in line with dynamic general equilibrium open economy models of risksharing, we exploit impulse response functions to trace the role of each smoothing channel over time, in the presence of different structural shocks (temporary vs. permanent and output vs. smoothing channels). In the application to the US and OECD countries, we find different dynamic properties of different smoothing channels. We compare our results with the predictions of standard risksharing and consumption theories, and tackle some of the puzzles in the literature, such as the ""international risksharing puzzle"" and the ""consumption-output correlation puzzle."" We are also able to address such policy issues as whether fiscal stabilizers have been substitutes or complements for financial market diversification activities and whether further financial market integration is likely to provide countries with more shock-absorption tools. A key result is the strong substitutability between capital and credit smoothing in the US, and between fiscal and credit smoothing in the OECD."

Decision rules have additional nonlinearity relative to fixed-regime models. Income allocation and the tax elasticity of investment depend on agents' inference regarding the regime. Specifically, the tax elasticity can be either positive or negative, depending on whether agents perceive a tax reform as an intra-regime shock or change in regime."

Using a two-country stochastic dynamic general equilibrium with nominal price stickiness and local currency pricing, we will show how the persistence of purchasing power parity deviations can be related to a monetary theory of these deviations. When monetary policy lean against the wind, there is no relationship of proportionality between the time during which prices remain sticky and the persistence of the response of the real exchange rate: in this case high nominal price rigidity is not sufficient, per se, in generating any persistence following a monetary shock. Moreover, we emphasize the role of interest rates smoothing policies and relative price stickiness within countries in understanding the relationship between the real exchange rate and monetary shocks. With reasonable parameters values, a wide range of monetary policy rules can generate real exchange rate autocorrelations around the ones observed in the data."

A main policy implication of this principle is that the Ramsey allocation with complete markets can be sustained with non-contingent debt only by properly managing its maturity structure. The numerical experiments, however, suggest that this policy implication ought to be taken with care. We find that the debt positions that sustain the Ramsey allocation are very high (on the order of a few hundred times total GDP for a very simple four state economy) and increasing in the number of states. In addition, they are very sensitive to small variations in the parameters of the model."

Agents who become entrepreneurs need to bear part of the project-specific risk for incentive reasons.

I study the Ramsey equilibrium in a monetary model with distortionary taxation, nominal non-state-contingent debt, and sticky prices. With sticky prices, the Ramsey planner must balance the shock absorbing benefits of state-contingent inflation against the associated resource misallocation costs. For government spending processes resembling post-war experience, introducing sticky prices generates striking departures in optimal policy from the case with flexible prices. For even small degrees of price rigidity, optimal policy displays very little volatility in inflation. Tax rates display greater volatility compared to the model with flexible prices. With sticky prices, tax rates and real government debt exhibit behavior similar to a random walk. For government spending processes resembling periods of intermittent war and peace, optimal policy displays extreme inflation volatility even when the degree of price rigidity is large. As the variability in government spending increases, smoothing tax distortions across states of nature becomes increasingly important, and the shock absorber role of inflation is accentuated."

Earnings inequality is exogenous and is calibrated to match data from the U.S. Panel Study on Income Dynamics. Consumption inequality is endogenous and matches well data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey. The total risk households face is decomposed into that realized before entering the labor market and that realized throughout the working years. In welfare terms, the latter is found to be more important than the former."

Shocks are identified by the reaction of three month market interest rates to policy announcements that were not themselves endogenous to economic news on the same day. The main result is that a 100 basis point contractionary shock will appreciate the exchange rate by 2-3 percent on impact. The association of interest rate hikes with depreciations that is sometimes observed during periods of exchange market pressure is mainly attributable to reverse causality."

286,"AB: The microevidence indicates that small firms grow faster than big firms. I argue that this relationship between the expected growth rate of a firm and its size may provide a microfoundation for the well-known high degree of persistence of shocks to aggregate output. The logic goes as follows. Almost any shock tends to temporarily alter firms' incentive to invest in growth thereby leading to a reallocation of firms across size categories. If small firms grow faster than big ones, the impact effect of the shock on aggregate output is gradually absorbed. But, as fast growing small firms become big and start to grow at the lower rate of big firms, the rate at which the shock is absorbed decreases over the adjustment path. As a result, shocks are absorbed, yet at a very low decreasing rate which induces long memory in aggregate output. I argue that this transmission mechanism may reconcile the microevidence with the observed degree of aggregate persistence. It requires changes in neither the number of firms in the market nor the rate of technological progress. It is merely the result of the cross-sectional heterogeneity that we observe in real economies."

Hence, the model requires smaller barriers to account for current income differences relative to models that focus only on steady states. Empirically, I find that differences in the beginning dates of modern growth explain large differences in incomes."

Many of these models regularly produce a ""price puzzle""--a rise in the aggregate price level in response to a contractionary innovation to monetary policy--unless commodity prices are included. Conventional wisdom maintains that commodity prices resolve the price puzzle because they contain information that helps the Federal Reserve forecast inflation. I examine a number of plausible alternative indicator variables and find little correlation between an ability to forecast inflation and an ability to resolve the price puzzle. Additionally, a subsample investigation reveals that evidence of a price puzzle is associated primarily with the 1959-1979 sample period, and that most indicators--including commodity prices--cannot resolve the puzzle over this period."

Our results show that this model can account for the following key responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock: a fall in the nominal interest rate, a rise in output, consumption, and investment, and a gradual increase in the price level. Finally, a detailed sensitivity analysis shows the model's results depend on the parameters assigned to critical structural features."

Both models are solved numerically, calibrated to UK aggregate and household data, and the predictions are compared to data on real interest rates constructed from the UK index-linked data.

In this paper we show that, as long as the population is finite and agents are sufficiently patient, a social norm establishing gift-exchange can substitute for money. However, for a given discount factor, population growth eventually leads to the breakdown of the social norm. Additionally, increases in the degree of specialization in the economy can also undermine the social norm. By contrast, monetary equilibrium exists independent of the population size. We conclude that money is essential as a medium of exchange when the population is large."

437,"AB: Modern business cycle theory involves developing models that explain stylized facts. For this strategy to be successful, these facts should be well established. In this paper, we focus on the stylized facts of international business cycles. We use the generalized method of moments and quarterly data from twenty industrialized countries to estimate and test hypotheses concerning pairwise cross-country correlations of macroeconomic aggregates. A remarkable common feature emerges: these correlations are mostly positive, not very high and of a similar order of magnitude. The most important discrepancy with the theory is the low cross-country correlation of consumption."

In contrast to shirking models in the efficiency wage literature, detected shirkers are not dismissed. Instead, they face a monetary punishment because they forego an increase in their compensation. Estimated versions of the model can generate the high variation in employment and low variation of real wages observed over the business cycle, and are consistent with existing qualitative evidence about the responses of the economy to fiscal policy shocks."

488,"AB: We study the implications for optimal monetary policy of introducing habit formation in consumption into a general equilibrium model with sticky prices. Habit formation affects the model's endogenous dynamics through its effects on both aggregate demand and households' supply of output. We show that the objective of monetary policy consistent with welfare maximization includes output stabilization, as well as inflation and output gap stabilization. We find that the variance of output increases under optimal policy, even though it acquires a higher implicit weight in the welfare function. We also find that a simple interest rate rule nearly achieves the welfare-optimal allocation, regardless of the degree of habit formation. In this rule, the optimal responses to inflation and the lagged interest rate are both declining in the size of the habit, although super-inertial policies remain optimal."

520,"AB: This paper incorporates risk-sharing employment contracts into an economy in which matching frictions characterize the labour market and in which agents cannot commit. In equilibrium, the terms of ongoing contracts are affected by those being negotiated in the job market because contracts must be self-enforcing. In this context, risk-sharing implies that hours worked and wages are negatively related, while enforcement considerations imply the converse. Overall, the sign of this relationship is ambiguous. Therefore, the existence of such contracts may explain why movements in hours worked appear weakly related to those in real wages in U.S. aggregate data."

A necessary and sufficient condition for an equilibrium to be efficient is that the nominal intraday interest rate be zero, even when the overnight rate is strictly positive. Because a market for liquidity may not achieve efficiency, this creates a role for the central bank. I allow for the possibility of moral hazard and study policies commonly used by central banks to reduce their exposure to risk. I show collateralized lending achieves the efficient allocation, while, for certain parameters, caps cannot prevent moral hazard."

The focus is on episodes that involve lumpy adjustment in capital or employment. There is evidence that these episodes involve also smooth changes in employment or capital. I examine the behavior of variables such as capital utilization, hours per worker, capacity utilization, materials and energy use. Plants use these margins of adjustment actively and in an economically meaningful way. Additionally, I describe the observed patterns of productivity during these adjustment episodes and propose some hypotheses that seem to fit them. The level of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) drops after spikes in investment or bursts in job destruction and recovers slowly afterward. These productivity costs seem to arise from the adoption of new technologies and the ensuing learning of how to use them as well as from building and destroying a particular organization of production. Bursts of job creation are not accompanied by significant movements in TFP."

We investigate the stock price response of affected industries to a sequence of 13 events culminating in the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) of 2002. In the industries most likely to be affected by TRIA--banking, construction, insurance, real estate investment trusts, transportation, and public utilities-the stock price effect was primarily negative. The Act was at best value-neutral for property-casualty insurers because it eliminated the option not to offer terrorism insurance. The negative response of the other industries may be attributable to the Act's impeding more efficient private market solutions, failing to address nuclear, chemical, and biological hazards, and reducing market expectations of federal assistance following future terrorist attacks."

Interbank payment disruptions appear to be a central feature of many US banking crises, and interbank payment disruptions seem likely to recur. Federal Reserve credit extension following September 11 succeeded in massively increasing the supply of banks' balances to satisfy the disruption-induced increase in demand and thereby ameliorate the effects of the shock. Relatively benign banking conditions helped make Fed credit policy manageable. An interbank payment disruption that coincided with less-favorable banking conditions could be more difficult to manage, given current daylight credit policies. Paying interest on reserves would facilitate improvements in daylight credit policy."

689,"AB: This paper analyzes the effect of terror on the economy. Terror endangers life such that the value of the future relative to the present is reduced. Hence, due to a rise in terror activity, investment goes down, and in the long run income and consumption go down as well. Governments can offset terror by putting tax revenues into the production of security. Facing a tide in terror, a government that acts optimally increases the proportion of output spent on defense, but does not fully offset the tide. Thus, when terror peaks the long run equilibrium with an optimizing government is of lower output and welfare. Next, we show that this theory of terror and the economy, helps to understand changes in trend and business cycle of the Israeli economy. The estimates show that terror has a large impact on the aggregate economy. Continued terror, at the level of the death toll by about the same size as due to car accidents, is expected to decrease annual consumption per capita by about 5% in 2004. Had Israel not suffered from terror during the last 3 years, we estimate that the output per capita would have been 10% higher than it is today."

724,"AB: We perform an empirical investigation of the macroeconomic consequences of international terrorism and interactions with alternative forms of collective violence. Our analysis is based on a rich unbalanced panel data set with annual observations on 177 countries from 1968 to 2000, which brings together information from the Penn World Table data set, the ITERATE data set for terrorist events, and data sets of external and internal conflict. We explore these data with cross-sectional and panel growth regression analysis and a structural VAR model. We find that, on average, the incidence of terrorism may have an economically significant negative effect on growth, albeit one that is considerably smaller and less persistent than that associated with either external wars or internal conflict. As well, terrorism is associated with a redirection of economic activity away from investment spending and towards government spending. However, our investigation also suggests important differences both regarding the incidence and the economic consequences of terrorism among different sets of countries. In OECD economies, in particular, terrorist incidents are considerably more frequent than in other nations, but the negative influence of these incidents on growth is smaller."

756,"AB: This paper conducts a systematic investigation of the incidence and economic costs of terrorist attacks at the country level. We use newly assembled datasets on terrorist attacks, natural disasters and currency crises to answer three different questions: what are the determinants of terrorism, is there an output cost following a terrorist attack, and is that cost larger or smaller in the case of democracies. We find that rich countries are the most prone to suffer attacks while democracies are, if anything, less vulnerable than other countries. The cost to output of a terrorist attack is quantitatively small and closely associated with the occurrence of an event rather than the number of casualties. Finally, we find robust evidence that a terrorist attack imposes a lower output cost the more democratic a country is."

787,"AB: This paper introduces a framework for analyzing the role of financial factors as a source of instability in small open economies. Our basic model is a dynamic open economy model with a tradeable good produced with capital and a country-specific factor. We also assume that firms face credit constraints, with the constraint being tighter at a lower level of financial development. A basic implication of this model is that economies at an intermediate level of financial development are more unstable than either very developed or very underdeveloped economies. This is true both in the sense that temporary shocks have large and persistent effects and also in the sense that these economies can exhibit cycles. Thus, countries that are going through a phase of financial development may become more unstable in the short run. Similarly, full capital account liberalization may destabilize the economy in economies at an intermediate level of financial development: phases of growth with capital inflows are followed by collapse with capital outflows. On the other hand, foreign direct investment does not destabilize."

We show how this information can be used to identify the effects of a monetary policy shock in a standard VAR. This alternative approach to identification is quite different, and, we argue, more plausible, than the conventional identifying restrictions. We find that a usual recursive identification of the model is rejected, as is any identification that insists on a monetary policy shock having an exactly zero effect on prices contemporaneously. We nevertheless agree with the conclusion of much of the VAR literature that only a small fraction of the variance of output can be attributed to monetary policy shocks."

In this paper, we use maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments (GMM) methods to explore the empirical importance of output expectations. We find little evidence that rational expectations of future output help determine current output, especially after taking into account the small-sample bias in GMM."

837,"AB: In emerging markets, external debt is denominated almost entirely in large, developed country currencies such as the U.S. dollar. This liability dollarization offers a channel through which exchange rate variation can lead to business cycle instability. When firms' assets are denominated in domestic currency and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency, an exchange rate depreciation worsens firms' balance sheets, which leads to higher capital costs and contractions in capital spending. To illustrate this, I construct a quantitative, sticky price, small open economy model in which a monetary policy induced devaluation leads to a persistent contraction in output. In this model, fixed exchange rates offer greater stability than an interest rule that targets inflation."

The idea has a long history in the macroeconomic literature, as reflected by the work of Pigou (Industrial Fluctuation, MacMillan, London, 1926). The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate the type of general equilibrium structure that can give rise to such phenomena. Second, we examine the extent to which such a model can explain the observed pattern of U.S. recessions (frequency, depth) without relying on technological regress. We argue that such a model offer a framework for understanding elements of both the recent U.S. recession and of the Asia downturns of the late 1990s."

Based on U.S. monthly data for the post-1982 period, we reject the non-borrowed-reserve and interest-rate targeting procedures. In contrast, we present evidence supporting targeting procedures implying more than one policy variable. We also always reject the orthogonality conditions between policy shocks and macroeconomic variables. We show that using invalid restrictions often produces misleading policy measures and dynamic responses. These results have important implications for the measurement of policy shocks and their temporal effects as well as for the estimation of the monetary authority's reaction function."

891,"AB: This study investigates an incomplete markets economy in which the saving behavior of a continuum of infinitely lived agents is influenced by precautionary saving motives and borrowing constraints. Agents can use two types of assets (interest bearing IOUS and money) to smooth consumption. Money is valued because of a timing friction in the bond market. In particular, the bond market closes before agents observe their idiosyncratic productivity shock. I find that the Friedman rule is not optimal for this economy. The results indicate that the optimal allocation has a rate of inflation of 10%, and a positive amount of private credit held by the government. A positive inflation rate transfers resources from agents with big endowments to those holding bonds which improves risk sharing, and therefore, welfare. However, for higher rates of inflation, agents economize on money holdings, offsetting the insurance effects, and causing a reduction in welfare. Furthermore, higher rates of inflation discourage agents from borrowing, and the endogenous lower bound on bond holdings is higher than the exogenous borrowing limit. High rates of inflation, therefore, exacerbate frictions in the bond market."

It assumes that the data are generated by a model in which output and output gap are not equivalent, while an econometrician follows the common practice of including only output in the VAR. The omission of the output gap is shown to spuriously produce a price puzzle (and several other incorrect conclusions) in a class of commonly used models. This can happen even if the model admits a triangular identification and if the forecasts produced by the misspecified VAR are optimal. When the model is tested on US data, all predictions are supported. A commodity price index is not needed to solve the puzzle."

We document the common patterns observed in the diffusion of this broad range of technologies. Our results suggest a pattern of trickle-down diffusion that is remarkably robust across technologies. Most of the technologies that we consider originate in advanced economies and are adopted there first. Subsequently, they trickle down to countries that lag economically. Our panel data analysis indicates that the most important determinants of the speed at which a country adopts technologies are the country's human capital endowment, type of government, degree of openness to trade, and adoption of predecessor technologies. We also find that the overall rate of diffusion has increased markedly since World War II because of the convergence in these variables across countries."

Industry conditions and innovation characteristics affect who wins the race and who markets the resulting product. Small firms market their innovations when they pioneer a new generation or improve quality in a young generation and license their innovations in mature generations. If old generation leaders ever market improvements in young generation goods, they do so early on. Leadership in mature generations persists. Tests on the rigid disk drive industry (1977-1997) provide empirical support. The results have implications for antitrust policies and policies governing employee non-compete agreements."

Innovations are less socially useful, but more profitable for the innovator, when they are adopted slowly and the innovator remains a monopolist. For this reason, rent-seeking, both public and private, plays an important role in determining the social usefulness of innovations. This paper examines the political economy of intellectual property, analyzing the trade-off between private and public rent-seeking. While it is true in principle that public rent-seeking may be a substitute for private rent-seeking, it is not true that this results always either in less private rent-seeking or in a welfare improvement. When the public sector itself is selfish and behaves rationally, we may experience the worst of public and private rent-seeking together."

In this paper, we extend our framework to assess the quantitative importance of education policy, when compared to labor market rigidity and product market regulation, other policy differences more commonly suggested to be responsible for US-Europe differences. A ""decomposition"" exercise using a calibrated version of our model assigns a major role to education policy in explaining US-Europe growth differences."

1111,"AB: Estimating the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy is complicated by the endogeneity of policy decisions and the fact that both interest rates and asset prices react to numerous other variables. This paper develops a new estimator that is based on the heteroskedasticity that exists in high-frequency data. We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the ""event-study"" approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities. The findings also suggest that the event-study estimates contain biases that make the estimated effects on stock prices appear too small and those on Treasury yields too large."

We also find considerable differences across genders with previous wages being more important for men and market wages being more important for women.

This additional precautionary saving is higher, when estimation risk is greater. Compared with a precautionary agent who is otherwise identical, but ignores estimation risk, the rational agent consumes less at the beginning of his life, but consumes more later, because of larger wealth accumulated from savings for estimation risk. The utility cost of ignoring estimation risk is also quantified in closed form."

The result arises from the decline in aggregate activity caused by unemployment insurance: both capital and labor inputs to production fall when benefits rise. Unlike most of the literature, I compute explicitly the cost of the transition path, agents are made better off by switching to a steady state with no unemployment insurance, but the welfare gain is approximately cut in half.

However, once convertibility was suspended, the value of each currency depended on the outcome of the war. From these exchange rates I extract a common trend and a common factor. Movements in the common trend are consistent with the quantity theory of money. The common factor contains information on contemporaries' expectations about the war's resolution.

20,"AB: While much research in political economy points out the benefits of ""limited government,"" political scientists have long emphasized the problems created in many less-developed nations by ""weak states,"" which lack the power to tax and regulate the economy and to withstand the political and social challenges from non-state actors. I construct a model in which the state apparatus is controlled by a self-interested ruler, who tries to divert resources for his own consumption, but who can also invest in socially productive public goods. Both weak and strong states create distortions. When the state is excessively strong, the ruler imposes such high taxes that economic activity is stifled. When the state is excessively weak, the ruler anticipates that he will not be able to extract rents in the future and underinvests in public goods. I show that the same conclusion applies in the analysis of both the economic power of the state (i.e., its ability to raise taxes) and its political power (i.e., its ability to remain entrenched from the citizens). I also discuss how under certain circumstances a different type of equilibrium, which I refer to as ""consensually strong state equilibrium,"" can emerge whereby the state is politically weak but is allowed to impose high taxes as long as a sufficient fraction of the proceeds are invested in public goods. The consensually strong state might best correspond to the state in OECD countries where taxes are high despite significant control by the society over the government."

A positive feedback from past to current levels of taxation and corruption arises either when wealth originating in corruption and rent seeking is considered unfair, or when the ability to engage in corruption is unevenly distributed in the population. This feedback introduces persistence in the size of the government and the levels of corruption and inequality. Multiple steady states exist in some cases."

52,"AB: IMF loans react to economic conditions but are also sensitive to political-economy variables. Loans tend to be larger and more frequent when a country has a bigger quota and more professional staff at the IMF and when a country is more connected politically and economically to the United States and major European countries. These results are of considerable interest for their own sake. More importantly for present purposes, the results provide instrumental variables for estimating the effects of IMF loan programs on economic growth and other variables. This instrumental estimation allows us to sort out the economic effects of the loan programs from the responses of IMF lending to economic conditions. The estimates show that a higher IMF loan-participation rate reduces economic growth. IMF lending does not have significant effects on investment, inflation, government consumption, and international openness. However, IMF loan participation has small negative effects on democracy and the rule of law. The reduction in the rule of law implies an additional, indirect channel whereby IMF lending reduces economic growth."

The political budget cycle in new democracies accounts for the finding of a budget cycle in larger samples that include these countries and disappears when they are removed from the larger sample. The political deficit cycle in new democracies accounts for findings in both developed and less developed economies, for the stronger cycle in weaker democracies, and for differences in the political cycle across governmental and electoral systems. Our findings may reconcile two contradictory views of pre-electoral manipulation, one that it is a useful instrument to gain voter support and a widespread empirical phenomenon, the other that voters punish rather than reward fiscal manipulation."

Using difference-in-difference estimation, we study the effects on economic performance, macroeconomic policy and structural policies. Our main contribution is the analysis of the joint effects of both liberalizations, and the finding that the sequence of reforms matters. Countries that first liberalize the economy and then become democracies do much better than countries that pursue the opposite sequence, in almost all dimensions."

116,"AB: We offer a contribution to the analysis of optimal monetary policy. We begin with a critical assessment of the existing literature, arguing that most work is based on implausible models of inflation-output dynamics. We then suggest that this problem may be solved with some recent behavioral models, which assume that price setters are slow to incorporate macroeconomic information into the prices they set. A specific such model is developed and used to derive optimal policy. In response to shocks to productivity and aggregate demand, optimal policy is price level targeting. Base drift in the price level, which is implicit in the inflation targeting regimes currently used in many central banks, is not desirable in this model. When shocks to desired markups are added, optimal policy is flexible targeting of the price level. That is, the central bank should allow the price level to deviate from its target for a while in response to these supply shocks, but it should eventually return the price level to its target path. Optimal policy can also be described as an elastic price standard: the central bank allows the price level to deviate from its target when output is expected to deviate from its natural rate."

132,"AB: Inflation, output and interest rate stabilization are all potential central bank objectives. We explore whether monetary policy should respond to asset price fluctuations when they are driven by irrational expectational shocks to the future returns to capital. In our model, an optimistic shock to future returns generates both an increase in equity prices and physical investment. The increased investment is inefficient and, thus, a central bank optimally responds to this expectations shocks. This induces a trade-off between stabilizing nominal prices and non-fundamental asset price movements. We compare the optimal policy under different assumptions: full versus limited information and commitment versus discretion. If the central bank has limited information about whether an asset price movement has a fundamental or non-fundamental origin, then the central bank responds less aggressively to the non-fundamental exuberance shocks than under full information. Without commitment, a central bank responds more aggressively to non-fundamental exuberance shocks."

Nominal wage rigidity would therefore become irrelevant because there is little need to cut nominal pay under high inflation, while the necessary cuts would occur under low inflation. We test this hypothesis by examining Swiss data in the 1990s, where wage inflation was low. Nominal wage rigidity proves robust in a low inflation environment, constituting a considerable obstacle to real wage adjustments. Real wages would indeed respond to unemployment without downward nominal rigidity. Moreover, wage sweep-ups caused by nominal rigidity correlate strongly to unemployment, suggesting downward nominal wage rigidity fuels unemployment."

Perhaps surprisingly, large bubbles are not eliminated in equilibrium nor do large bubbles necessarily imply large distortions. Using the variance of analysts' earnings forecasts to proxy for the dispersion of investor beliefs, we find that increases in dispersion cause increases in new equity issuance, Tobin's Q, and real investment, as predicted by the model."

The model developed here fits this by letting consumers react negatively only when they become convinced that prices are unfair. This can explain price rigidity, though its implications are not identical to those of existing models of costly price adjustment. In particular, the frequency of price adjustment can depend on economy-wide variables observed by consumers. This has implications for the effects of monetary policy and can explain why inflation does not fall immediately after a monetary tightening."

As a result, taking equilibrium-selection effects into account leads to a lower optimal tax rate."

In overlapping generations (OG) models, by contrast, the Friedman rule may not be optimal. In this paper, we use this difference in monetary policy prescriptions to help us identify and study the key difference between these two models as models of money. We study the welfare properties of monetary policy in a simple OG model under two very different money demand specifications and two alternative assumptions about the generational timing of taxes for money retirement. We conclude that the key difference between ILRA and OG monetary models is that in the latter, the standard method for constructing a monetary regime causes transactions involving money to become intergenerational transfers. Under alternative government fiscal/monetary regimes that offset these intergenerational transfers, the Friedman rule is always optimal."

We discuss how to implement the optimal policy with minimal information requirement and evaluate the robustness of these simple rules when the central bank may not know the exact sources of shocks or nominal rigidities. A main finding is that a simple hybrid rule under which the short-term interest rate responds to CPI inflation and PPI inflation results in a welfare level close to the optimum, whereas policy rules that ignore PPI inflation or PPI sector shocks can result in significant welfare losses."

Optimal rules maximize the unconditional expected utility of the representative agent with commitment subject to the information set of the policymaker. Even with monopolistic distortions, the optimal full-information rule makes the economy mimic the hypothetical full-flexibility equilibrium. Strict versions of inflation targeting, nominal-income-growth targeting, and other such simple rules are suboptimal under both full and partial information but flexible versions are optimal under certain partial-information assumptions.

Prior studies have shown that the impact of a large trader on a currency crisis depends positively on his ""size"" and informational position. By contrast, this article highlights the role that market sentiment has on the impact of a large trader. If the market believes that fundamentals are weak, then the probability of a crisis depends positively on the trader's size but negatively on the precision of his information, with these effects reversed in a generally optimistic market. A large player, therefore, need not make market responses more aggressive."

330,"AB: Careful examination of aggregate data from the U.S. and other OECD countries reveals that production and inventory behavior exhibit paradoxical features: (1) Inventory investment is strongly countercyclical at very high frequencies (e.g., 2-3 quarters per cycle), it is procyclical only at relatively low-cyclical frequencies such as the business-cycle frequencies (e.g., 8-40 quarters per cycle). (2) Production is less volatile than sales around the high frequencies, it is more volatile than sales only around business-cycle or lower frequencies. (3) Unlike capital investment or GDP, the bulk of the variance of inventory investment is concentrated around high frequencies rather than around business-cycle frequencies. These features of production and inventory behavior at the low and high frequencies provide a litmus test for inventory theories. This paper shows that the stockout-avoidance theory [Kahn, J., 1987. Inventories and the volatility of production. American Economic Review 77, 667-679.] has much better potential than other competing theories for explaining the seemingly paradoxical features of inventory fluctuations observed at different cyclical frequencies. My analysis suggests that demand shocks are the main source of the business cycle."

Simulations of a standard neoclassical growth model suggest that foresight of only one quarter can distort substantially the estimates of tax effects obtained under the no-foresight assumption. Also, it is crucial to model capital and labor taxes separately: anticipated changes in these two tax policies have opposite effects on consumption, investment, labor, and output before policy realization."

Evaluation across models is typically based on an exogenously specified loss function. However, the theory on which many recent monetary policy models are based implies that changes in the structure of the model also have consequences for the policy objectives the central bank should pursue. Objectives are endogenous, not exogenous to the model. In this paper, I investigate the impact of endogenous objectives on the evaluation of targeting rules for monetary policy."

457,"AB: Recent empirical research shows that a reasonable characterization of federal-funds-rate targeting behavior is that the change in the target rate depends on the maturity structure of interest rates and exhibits little dependence on lagged target rates. See, for example, Cochrane and Piazzesi [2002. The Fed and interest rates--a high-frequency identification. American Economic Review 92, 90-95.]. The result echoes the policy rule used by McCallum [1994a. Monetary policy and the term structure of interest rates. NBER Working Paper No. 4938.] to rationalize the empirical failure of the ""expectations hypothesis"" applied to the term structure of interest rates. That is, rather than forward rates acting as unbiased predictors of future short rates, the historical evidence suggests that the correlation between forward rates and future short rates is surprisingly low. McCallum showed that a desire by the monetary authority to adjust short rates in response to exogenous shocks to the term premiums imbedded in long rates (i.e. ""yield-curve smoothing""), along with a desire for smoothing interest rates across time, can generate term structures that account for the puzzling regression results of Fama and Bliss [1987. The information in long-maturity forward rates. The American Economic Review 77, 680-392.]. McCallum also clearly pointed out that this reduced-form approach to the policy rule, although naturally forward looking, needed to be studied further in the context of other response functions such as the now standard Taylor [1993. Discretion versus policy rules in practice. Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 39, 195-214.] Rule. We explore both the robustness of McCallum's result to endogenous models of the term premium and also its connections to the Taylor Rule. We model the term premium endogenously using two different models in the class of affine term-structure models studied in Duffie and Kan [1996. A yield-factor model of interest rates. Mathematical Finance 57, 405-443.]: a stochastic volatility model and a stochastic price-of-risk model. We then solve for equilibrium term structures in environments in which interest rate targeting follows a rule such as the one suggested by McCallum (i.e., the ""McCallum Rule""). We demonstrate that McCallum's original result generalizes in a natural way to this broader class of models. To understand the connection to the Taylor Rule, we then consider two structural macroeconomic models which have reduced forms that correspond to the two affine models and provide a macroeconomic interpretation of abstract state variables (as in Ang and Piazzessi [2003. A no-arbitrage vector autoregression of term structure dynamics with macroeconomic and latent variables. Journal of Monetary Economics 50, 745-787.]). Moreover, such structural models allow us to interpret the parameters of the term-structure model in terms of the parameters governing preferences, technologies, and policy rules. We show how a monetary policy rule will manifest itself in the equilibrium asset-pricing kernel and, hence, the equilibrium term structure. We then show how this policy can be implemented with an interest-rate targeting rule. This provides us with a set of restrictions under which the Taylor and McCallum Rules are equivalent in the sense if implementing the same monetary policy. We conclude with some numerical examples that explore the quantitative link between these two models of monetary policy."

507,"AB: The reduction in inflation that occurred in the early 1980s, when the Federal Reserve was headed by Paul Volcker, is arguably the most widely discussed and visible macroeconomic event of the last 50 years of U.S. history. Inflation had been dramatically rising, but under Volcker, the Fed first contained and then reversed this process. Using a simple modern macroeconomic model, we argue that the real effects of the Volcker disinflation were mainly due to its imperfect credibility. In our view, the observed upward volatility and subsequent stubborn elevation of long-term interest rates during the disinflation are key indicators of that imperfect credibility. Studying transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee recently released to the public, we find--to our surprise--that Volcker and other FOMC members likewise regarded the long-term interest rates as indicative of inflation expectations and of the credibility of their disinflationary policy. Drawing from the transcripts and other contemporary sources, we consider the interplay of monetary targets, operating procedures, and credibility during the Volcker disinflation."

In this paper we estimate a dynamic optimizing business cycle model whose price-setting behavior satisfies the natural rate hypothesis. The price-adjustment specifications we consider are the sticky-information specification of Mankiw and Reis (Sticky information versus sticky prices: a proposal to replace the new Keynesian Phillips curve. Quarterly Journal of Economics 117, 1295-1328) and the indexed contracts of Christiano et al. (Nominal rigidities and the dynamic effects of a shock to monetary policy.

Consequently, the alternative model specifications deliver similar estimates of the U.S. output gap series, but the empirical behavior of the gap series differs substantially from standard gap estimates."

External competitive pressures also seem to affect U.K. inflation via their impact on the equilibrium price markup of domestic firms."

Applying these restrictions to US data leads to the following findings: (i) Business cycles implied by productivity shocks are mildly correlated to overall fluctuations and help account for a few episodes of US postwar recessions. However, only 20% of US fluctuations can be explained by these shocks. (ii) Most fluctuations seem instead to be due to ""nominal demand"" shocks, i.e. shocks which move output and prices in the same direction, but whose effects on output are ultimately transitory. (iii) Canonical sticky price models in the new-neoclassical synthesis tradition can account for the cyclical comovements of output and prices, but canonical, frictionless, RBC models cannot."

Journal of Monetary Eonomics 44(2), 195-222] developed a hybrid variant of the New Keynesian Phillips curve that relates inflation to real marginal cost, expected future inflation and lagged inflation. GMM estimates of the model suggest that forward-looking behavior is dominant: the coefficient on expected future inflation substantially exceeds the coefficient on lagged inflation. While the latter differs significantly from zero, it is quantitatively modest. Several authors have suggested that our results are the product of specification bias or suspect estimation methods. Here we show that these claims are incorrect, and that our results are robust to a variety of estimation procedures, including GMM estimation of the closed form, and nonlinear instrumental variables. Also, as we discuss, many others have obtained very similar results to ours using a systems approach, including FIML techniques. Hence, the conclusions of GG and others regarding the importance of forward-looking behavior remain robust."

681,"AB: The New-Keynesian Phillips curve has recently become an important ingredient in monetary policy models. However, using limited information methods, the empirical support for the New-Keynesian Phillips curve appear to be mixed. This paper argues, by means of Monte Carlo simulations with a simple New-Keynesian sticky price model, that single equations methods, e.g. GMM, are likely to produce imprecise and biased estimates. Then, it is argued that estimating the model with full information maximum likelihood (FIML) is a useful way of obtaining better estimates. Finally, a version of the model used in the Monte Carlo simulations is estimated on U.S. data with FIML and although the pure forward-looking New-Keynesian Phillips curve is rejected, a version with both forward- and backward-looking components provides a reasonable approximation of U.S. inflation dynamics."

As a result, several extensions have been suggested to improve its fit to the data. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate and compare the baseline sticky price model of Calvo's [1983. Staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 383-398.] and three extensions. Our empirical results are as follows. First, we find that adding price indexation improves the fit of Calvo's [1983. Staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 383-398.] model. Second, models with both staggered price and wage setting dominate models with only price rigidities. Third, introducing wage indexation does not significantly improve the fit. Fourth, all model estimates suggest a high degree of price stickiness. Fifth, the estimates of labor supply elasticity are higher in models with both staggered price and wage contracts. Finally, the estimated inflation parameters of the Taylor rule are stable across models."

Do these lags reflect backward-looking inflation expectations, or do they proxy for rational forward-looking expectations, as in the new-Keynesian Phillips curve? Gali and Gertler [1999. Inflation dynamics: a structural econometric analysis. Journal of Monetary Economics 44, 195-222] attempt to answer this question using GMM to estimate specifications incorporating both lagged and future inflation. They report small coefficients on lagged inflation and conclude that the new-Keynesian model provides a good first approximation to inflation dynamics. We show that these tests have low power against alternative backward-looking specifications, and demonstrate that their results are also consistent with a backward-looking Phillips curve. Using an alternative approach, we find that the new-Keynesian pricing model cannot explain the importance of lagged inflation in standard inflation regressions, and find that forward-looking terms play a very limited role in explaining inflation dynamics."

An inward-looking policy of domestic price stabilization is not optimal when firms' markups are exposed to currency fluctuations. Such a policy raises exchange rate volatility, leading foreign exporters to charge higher prices vis-a-vis increased uncertainty in the export market. As higher import prices reduce the purchasing power of domestic consumers, optimal monetary rules trade off a larger domestic output gap against lower consumer prices. Optimal rules in a world Nash equilibrium lead to less exchange rate volatility relative to both inward-looking rules and discretionary policies, even when the latter do not suffer from any inflationary (or deflationary) bias. Gains from international monetary cooperation are related in a non-monotonic way to the degree of exchange rate pass-through."

We test this hypothesis for the Classical gold standard using a newly created monthly data base for the period 1880-1913. Building on the recently noted finding that the Classical gold standard represented a credible, well-behaved, target zone system we propose a number of ways of testing the Svensson' model. Our main finding is that the Classical gold standard did indeed confer some independence in the operation of monetary policy for participating countries. This would seem to have an important bearing on the kind of institutional framework required for a modern day target zone to function effectively and, in particular, to weather speculative attacks."

We assume that government bonds provide arbitrarily small transactions services and show that this can dramatically change the local and global determinacy conditions. In particular, the specification of fiscal policy affects the aggressiveness with which monetary policy must respond to inflation to deliver local determinacy--a range of passive monetary policies, even an interest rate peg, may yield determinacy."

Country risk is affected by fundamental shocks but, through the presence of working capital, also amplifies the effects of those shocks.

818,"AB: This paper proposes to estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks by a new agnostic method, imposing sign restrictions on the impulse responses of prices, nonborrowed reserves and the federal funds rate in response to a monetary policy shock. No restrictions are imposed on the response of real GDP to answer the key question in the title. I find that ""contractionary"" monetary policy shocks have no clear effect on real GDP, even though prices move only gradually in response to a monetary policy shock. Neutrality of monetary policy shocks is not inconsistent with the data."

836,"AB: The expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates describes a conventional view of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy where bond rates reflect current and expected movements in the policy-controlled rate. However, empirical rejections of the expectations hypothesis are commonplace and lead many to question this description of policy transmission. This paper argues that failure to account for imperfect policy credibility may explain empirical rejections. Empirical rejections may occur even when changing anticipations of future short rates are the primary source of variation in bond rates and the standard term structure transmission channel remains valid."

Under the assumptions of unit intertemporal elasticity of substitution and zero net supply of riskless assets, I show analytically that binding margin requirements do not affect stock prices. This result stands in contrast to previous partial equilibrium analysis where fixed margin requirements increase the volatility of stock prices. In this framework, binding margin requirements induce a fall in the riskless rate, increase its volatility, and increase stock trading volume."

The current literature on this persistency puzzle has focused on augmenting the nominal contract model with imperfect credibility and learning. In this paper, I re-examine the persistency puzzle by focusing on the discretionary nature of monetary policy. I show that when the central bank is allowed to re-optimize a quadratic loss function each period, imperfect credibility and learning, even in the absence of staggered contracts, can generate a significant amount of inflation persistence and employment losses during a disinflationary period."

Unlike previous studies, we model inflation as non-linearly related to fiscal deficits through the inflation tax base and estimate this relationship as intrinsically dynamic, using panel techniques that explicitly distinguish between short- and long-run effects of fiscal deficits. Results spanning 107 countries over 1960-2001 show a strong positive association between deficits and inflation among high-inflation and developing country groups, but not among low-inflation advanced economies."

A key feature of the model is that household consumption cannot fall below a positive level each period. The existence of a minimum consumption requirement implies that the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution not only differs across households but also changes differently over time. This model is calibrated to match some key aggregate statistics of the U.S. economy. We find that, as in the data, the wealth distribution in our benchmark model economy exhibits a (brief) period of increasing inequality, a short period in which inequality diminishes and a steady level of inequality along the balanced growth path. However, our model illustrates that the evolution of inequality is very sensitive to the length of the transition path. Additionally, our model predicts an upsurge in wealth inequality following the productivity slowdown in the 1970s."

Broadening the scope of education finance has intragenerational redistribution effects as well as intergenerational effects. Previous studies have emphasized the intragenerational redistribution effects of moving from local to state-financed systems, while holding factor prices fixed. The model in this paper includes a social security system and allows factor prices to vary endogenously. I examine the welfare effects of broadening the scope of financing from a community- to a nation-wide system and find that there are very large welfare gains as voters ""internalize"" the effect of the education policy on both factor prices and social security benefits. I also focus on the intergenerational distributional effects, finding that significant welfare gains occur despite the displacement of the median voter to an older agent that cares less about children's well-being."

1111,"AB: Latin American countries are the only Western countries that are poor and that are not gaining ground on the U.S. This paper evaluates why Latin America has not replicated Western economic success. We find that this failure is primarily due to TFP differences. Latin America's TFP gap is not plausibly accounted for by human capital differences, but rather reflects inefficient production. We argue that competitive barriers are a promising channel for understanding low Latin TFP. We document that Latin America has many more international and domestic competitive barriers than do Western and successful East Asian countries. We also document a number of microeconomic cases in Latin America in which large reductions in competitive barriers increase Latin American productivity to Western levels."

1175,"AB: The integration of European financial markets in the early 1980s created an environment of near-perfect capital mobility across countries that had harmonized indirect taxes but maintained large differences in factor taxes. The years that followed witnessed several rounds of competition in capital taxes with puzzling results. Instead of the dreaded ""race to the bottom"" in capital taxes, the UK lowered its capital tax to a rate closer to those of France, Germany and Italy, while capital taxes changed slightly in these countries. The UK increased its labor tax marginally, but the other countries increased theirs sharply. This paper shows that these results are consistent with the quantitative predictions of a dynamic, Neoclassical general equilibrium model of tax competition that incorporates the key international externalities of tax policy operating via relative prices, wealth distribution and fiscal solvency. Tax competition is modeled as a one-shot game over time-invariant capital taxes with dynamic payoffs relative to a status quo calibrated to European data. The calibration is preceded by an empirical analysis that shows that the relationship linking taxes to labor supply and the investment rate in the model are in line with empirical evidence and that domestic taxes seem to respond to foreign taxes. The solutions of the games show that when countries compete over capital taxes adjusting labor taxes to maintain fiscal solvency, there is no race to the bottom and the Nash equilibrium is close to observed taxes. In contrast, if consumption taxes adjust to maintain fiscal solvency, competition over capital taxes triggers a ""race to the bottom,"" but this outcome entails large welfare gains. Surprisingly, the gains from coordination are small in all of these experiments."

Using quantitative general equilibrium models which incorporate a ""generalized (S,s) approach,"" we investigate the implications of SDP for topics in two major areas of macroeconomic research, the early 1990s SDP literature and more recent work on persistence mechanisms. First, we show that state-dependent pricing leads to unusual macroeconomic dynamics, which occur because of the timing of price adjustments chosen by firms as in the earlier literature. In particular, we display an example in which output responses peak at about a year, while inflation responses peak at about 2 years after the shock. Second, we examine whether the persistence-enhancing effects of two New Keynesian model features, namely specific factor markets and variable elasticity demand curves, depend importantly on whether pricing is state dependent. In an SDP setting, we provide examples in which specific factor markets perversely work to lower persistence, while variable elasticity demand raises it."

We then study a calibrated model economy where capital reallocation is costly and impute the cost of reallocation. We find that the cost of reallocation needs to be substantially countercyclical to be consistent with the observed joint cyclical properties of reallocation and productivity dispersion."

In the model, crises are caused by the interaction of bad fundamentals, self-fulfilling runs and policies by three classes of optimizing agents: international investors, the local government and an international official lender. Limited contingent liquidity support helps to prevent liquidity runs by raising the number of investors willing to lend to the country for any given fundamentals, i.e., it can have catalytic effects. The influence of the official lender is increasing in the size of its interventions and the precision of its information. Unlike the conventional view stressing debtor moral hazard, our model identifies circumstances in which official lending actually strengthens a government's incentive to implement desirable but costly policies."

In a New Keynesian model of output gap and inflation determination in which private agents face multi-period decision problems, but have non-rational expectations and learn over time, if the monetary authority adopts a forecast-based instrument rule and responds to observed private forecasts then this class of policies frequently induce divergent learning dynamics. A central bank that correctly understands private behavior can mitigate such instability by responding to the determinants of private forecasts. This suggests gathering information on the determinants of expectations to be useful."

Despite the fact that money is the only asset, the model captures most of the variability of velocity in the data.

It can vary the degree of coordination between unions, and alternatively consider ""national"" and ""sectorial"" unions. Calibration to the union premium implies a workers' rent extraction parameter much lower than assumed in the matching literature. We introduce unemployment insurance to study the interactions of policies with unions and find that unions only push for more generous benefits if this does not entail higher payroll taxes."

123,"AB: This paper investigates how the occasional long swing in the business cycle can produce long-memory behavior in US output. To prove this theoretical relationship, we extend the Hamilton Markov chain regime switching model of real aggregate output to include the occasional long regime. We do this by modeling the duration length of the expansion and recession regimes as draws from a fat-tailed distribution with realized durations that are high in variability and occasionally extreme in value. Empirically, we find that the tail indices for the length of US economic booms and busts correspond with the long-memory parameter estimates of Diebold and Rudebusch [1989. Long memory and persistence in aggregate output. Journal of Monetary Economics 24, 189-209] and Sowell [1992a. Modeling long-run behavior with the fractional ARIMA model. Journal of Monetary Economics 29, 277-302] for real US output. Estimates of our extended regime switching model produce better short- and long-run forecasts of output in comparison to forecasts with a fractionally integrated model. Furthermore, our estimated regime-switching model finds US expansions to be fragile during their infancy, but become more and more likely to continue after surviving the first seven quarters."

Our analysis shows that general equilibrium considerations along with bankruptcy chapter choice and production matter crucially for the effects of policy reform. Contrary to previous work, we find that completely eliminating bankruptcy provisions causes significant declines in output and welfare by reducing capital formation and labor input. Furthermore, subjecting Chapter 7 filers to means testing, as suggested by recent legislative proposals, would not improve upon current bankruptcy provisions and, at best, leave aggregate filings, output, and welfare unchanged. However, we do find that an alternative tightening of Chapter 7, in the form of lower asset exemptions, can increase economic efficiency."

However, the government's limitations in properly pricing FDIC insurance are leading to many current examples of moral hazard. A model is presented to show that if insurance premiums are set to be ""actuarially fair,"" incentives for banks to take excessive systematic risks remain. Motivated by empirical evidence that money market mutual funds also can hedge liquidity shocks, I consider an alternative government insurance system that mitigates distortions to risk-taking yet preserves liquidity hedging and information synergies."

204,"AB: Emerging market economies are fertile ground for the development of real estate and other financial bubbles. Despite these economies' significant growth potential, their corporate and government sectors do not generate the financial instruments to provide residents with adequate stores of value. Capital often flows out of these economies seeking these stores of value in the developed world. Bubbles are beneficial because they provide domestic stores of value and thereby reduce capital outflows while increasing investment. But they come at a cost, as they expose the country to bubble-crashes and capital flow reversals. We show that domestic financial underdevelopment not only facilitates the emergence of bubbles, but also leads agents to undervalue the aggregate risk embodied in financial bubbles. In this context, even rational bubbles can be welfare reducing. We study a set of aggregate risk management policies to alleviate the bubble-risk. We show that liquidity requirements, sterilization of capital inflows and structural policies aimed at developing public debt markets ""collateralized"" by future revenues, all have a high payoff in this environment."

We find significant heterogeneity in covariance risk across consumers. Also, the amount of credit they obtain significantly increases with their credit scores, and decreases with their covariance risk (especially revolving credit), though the effect of covariance risk is smaller."

Others have suggested that they may be undesirable if they increase the risk of financial crises. Using a model with banking and insurance sectors, we show that credit risk transfer can be beneficial when banks face uniform demand for liquidity. However, when they face idiosyncratic liquidity risk and hedge this risk in an interbank market, credit risk transfer can be detrimental to welfare. It can lead to contagion between the two sectors and increase the risk of crises."

Research has focused primarily on the role played by milder economic shocks, improved inventory management, and better monetary policy. This paper explores another potential explanation: financial innovation. Examples of such innovation include developments in lending practices and loan markets that have enhanced the ability of households and firms to borrow and changes in government policy such as the demise of Regulation Q. We employ a variety of simple empirical techniques to identify links between the observed moderation in economic activity and the influence of financial innovation on consumer spending, housing investment, and business fixed investment. Our results suggest that financial innovation should be added to the list of likely contributors to the mid-1980s stabilization."

Their hybrid government-private status, and the perception that they are too big to fail, make them a potentially large, but largely unaccounted for, risk to the federal government. Measuring the size and risk of this liability is technically difficult, but important for the debate over the appropriate regulation of these institutions. Here we take an options pricing approach to evaluating these costs and risks. Under the base case assumptions, the estimated value of the guarantees is $7.9 billion over 10 years, with a combined .5 percent value at risk of $122 billion. We evaluate the sensitivity of these estimates to various modeling assumptions, and also to the regulatory regime, including forbearance policies and capital requirements. The analysis highlights the benefits, but also the challenges, of taking an options-based approach to evaluating the value of federal credit guarantees."

360,AB: This paper studies a state-dependent pricing model in which firms face a fixed cost of changing their pricing plans. A pricing plan specifies an entire sequence of time-varying future prices. Allowing firms to choose a pricing plan rather than a single price generates inflation inertia in the response of the economy to small changes in the growth rate of money. Allowing firms to choose when to change their pricing plan generates a non-linear response of inflation and output to small and large changes in the money growth rate. The non-linear solution method also reveals that the model generates an asymmetric response of output and inflation to monetary expansions and contractions.

Capital controls drive a wedge between the price of local shares and their corresponding cross-listed shares. This wedge provides an implicit devaluation forecast and the market's valuation of capital control circumvention."

394,"AB: Traditional theory attributes fluctuations in real exchange rates to changes in the relative price of nontraded goods. This paper studies the relation between the United States' bilateral real exchange rate and the associated bilateral relative price of nontraded goods for five of its most important trade relationships. We find that this relation depends crucially on the choice of price series used to measure relative prices and on the choice of trade partner. The relation is stronger when we measure relative prices using producer prices rather than consumer prices. The relation is stronger the more important is the trade relationship between the United States and a trade partner. Even in cases where there is a strong relation between the real exchange rate and the relative price of nontraded goods, however, a large fraction of real exchange rate fluctuations is due to deviations from the law of one price for traded goods."

We formulate a two-sector general equilibrium model that is calibrated both to match the sectoral responses to a monetary shock derived from our empirical VAR and to imply an empirically realistic degree of sectoral output volatility and comovement. While the social welfare function involves sector-specific output gaps and inflation rates, the performance of the optimal policy rule can be closely approximated by a simple rule that targets a weighted average of aggregate wage and price inflation. In contrast, a rule that stabilizes a more narrow measure of final goods price inflation performs poorly in terms of social welfare."

464,"AB: The expectations model of the term structure has been subjected to numerous empirical tests and almost invariably rejected, with the failure generally attributed to systematic expectations errors or to shifts in risk premia. Rules for monetary policy designed along the lines of Taylor [1993. Discretion versus policy rules in practice. Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 39, 195-214] specify that the central bank adjusts short-term yields in response to deviations of inflation and output gaps from target level. Such rules give a good empirical account of the behavior of the short-term interest rate. Combining the Taylor rule and expectations theory, it is possible to generate--along lines pioneered by Campbell and Shiller [1987. Cointegration and tests of present value models. Journal of Political Economy 95, 1062-1088]--a series of theoretical long-term interest rates. When such theoretical rates are calculated for the US over 1980-2004, considerable support for the expectations theory emerges."

The long-term rate responds asymmetrically to changes in the short-term rate, and by less than that is predicted by the benchmark linear model. In particular, a decrease in the short-term rate produces a smaller response in the long-term rate than an increase of the same magnitude.

518,"AB: This paper computes the optimal progressivity of the income tax code in a dynamic general equilibrium model with household heterogeneity in which uninsurable labor productivity risk gives rise to a nontrivial income and wealth distribution. A progressive tax system serves as a partial substitute for missing insurance markets and enhances an equal distribution of economic welfare. These beneficial effects of a progressive tax system have to be traded off against the efficiency loss arising from distorting endogenous labor supply and capital accumulation decisions. Using a utilitarian steady state social welfare criterion we find that the optimal US income tax is well approximated by a flat tax rate of 17.2% and a fixed deduction of about $9,400. The steady state welfare gains from a fundamental tax reform towards this tax system are equivalent to 1.7% higher consumption in each state of the world. An explicit computation of the transition path induced by a reform of the current towards the optimal tax system indicates that a majority of the population currently alive (roughly 62%) would experience welfare gains, suggesting that such fundamental income tax reform is not only desirable, but may also be politically feasible."

536,"AB: In this paper we reconcile two opposing views about the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). Empirical studies using aggregate consumption data typically find the EIS to be close to zero, whereas calibrated models designed to match growth and fluctuations facts typically require it to be close to one. This contradiction is resolved when two kinds of heterogeneity are acknowledged: one, the majority of households do not participate in stock markets, and two, the EIS increases with wealth. We introduce these two features into a standard real business cycle model. First, limited participation creates substantial wealth inequality as in the U.S. data. Consequently, the properties of aggregates directly linked to wealth (e.g., investment and output) are mainly determined by the (high-EIS) stockholders. Since consumption is much more evenly distributed than is wealth, estimation from aggregate consumption uncovers the low EIS of the majority (i.e., the poor)."

Our results indicate that increasing the generosity of UI crowds out 401(k) contributions made by younger workers, who save primarily for precautionary reasons. At the aggregate level, we find that 401(k)s increase national saving and that the magnitude of the effect depends on the generosity of UI."

Investing some of it instead in equities while continuing to pay Social Security benefits under existing rules would alter--potentially improve--the sharing of financial risks across non-trading generations. This paper shows that the same risk sharing can be achieved without direct government ownership of equities if instead the government places a linear and symmetric tax on risky private capital returns. This equivalence is very robust and holds even if some agents are endogenously borrowing constrained.

Moreover, for plausible parameter values, the model can explain the excess smoothness and excess sensitivity observed in U.S. aggregate data. The result follows from a gradual adjustment of consumption to permanent income shocks when agents attempt to spread out the burden of down payments over time, compounded by slow adjustment due to transaction costs."

676,"AB: Central banking is intimately related to liquidity provision to banks during times of crisis, the lender-of-last-resort function. This activity arose endogenously in certain banking systems. Depositors lack full information about the value of bank assets, so that during macroeconomic downturns they monitor their banks by withdrawing in a banking panic. The likelihood of panics depends on the industrial organization of the banking system. Banking systems with well-diversified big banks are less prone to inefficient bank runs because diversification alleviates the information asymmetry. In addition, big banks can self-monitor through publicly observable branch closure. Systems of many small banks form incentive-compatible bank coalitions to emulate the big banks during times of crisis. Such coalitions improve efficiency by monitoring member banks and issuing money that is a kind of deposit insurance--a precursor of central banking."

Surprisingly, we show that when a VaR constraint is imposed, it is plausible that certain banks will end up selecting 'riskier' portfolios than they would have chosen in the absence of the constraint. Accordingly, regulators such as the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision should be aware that allowing a bank to use VaR to determine its minimum regulatory capital may increase its fragility. Alternatives to VaR-based bank capital regulation that mitigate or even preclude its perverse implications are presented."

710,"AB: This paper analyzes dynamic equilibrium risk sharing contracts between profit-maximizing intermediaries and a large pool of ex ante identical agents that face idiosyncratic income uncertainty that makes them heterogeneous ex post. In any given period, after having observed her income, the agent can walk away from the contract, while the intermediary cannot, i.e., there is one-sided commitment. We consider the extreme scenario that the agents face no costs to walking away, and can sign up with any competing intermediary without any reputational losses. We demonstrate that not only autarky, but also partial and full insurance can obtain, depending on the relative patience of agents and financial intermediaries. Insurance can be provided because in an equilibrium contract an up-front payment effectively locks in the agent with an intermediary. We then show that our contract economy is equivalent to a consumption-savings economy with one-period Arrow securities and a short-sale constraint, similar to Bulow and Rogoff [1989. Sovereign debt: is to forgive to forget? American Economic Review 79, 43-50]. From this equivalence and our characterization of dynamic contracts it immediately follows that without cost of switching financial intermediaries debt contracts are not sustainable, even though a risk allocation superior to autarky can be achieved."

The constrained-efficient allocation can be sustained when bonds have positive yields and, under certain conditions, only if they are illiquid. Illiquidity, meaning that bonds cannot be transformed into consumption as easily as cash, is necessary to eliminate arbitrage opportunities due to disparities in shadow interest rates."

We compare cyclical movements in levels, deviations from trend, and smoothed growth rates for both the quarterly real GDP and the monthly U.S. Coincident Index--using the phase average trend (PAT). Then we compare alternative trend estimates, deterministic and stochastic, linear and nonlinear, and the corresponding series of deviations from these trends. We discuss how the resulting estimates differ for U.S. growth cycles in the post-World War II period. The results of PAT show great similarity to the results obtained with the Hodrick-Prescott, local linear trend, band-pass filtering methods."

However, equity premia imply that marginal utility growth varies much more, by at least 50% per year. Therefore, marginal utility growth must be highly correlated across countries: international risk sharing is better than you think. Conversely, if risks really are not shared internationally, exchange rates should vary more than they do: exchange rates are too smooth. We calculate an index of international risk sharing that formalizes this intuition. We treat carefully the realistic case of incomplete capital markets.

796,"AB: Emerging market crises are characterized by large swings in both macroeconomic fundamentals and asset prices. The economic significance of observed movements in macroeconomic variables is obscured by the brief and extreme nature of crises. In this paper we propose to study the macroeconomic consequences of crises by studying the behavior of ""effective"" fundamentals, constructed by studying the relative movements of stock prices during crises. We find that these effective fundamentals provide a different picture than that implied by observed fundamentals. First, asset prices often reflect expectations of improvement in fundamentals after the initial devaluations, specifically, effective depreciations are positive but not as large as the observed ones. Second, crises vary in their effect on credit market conditions, with investors expecting tightening of credit in some cases (Mexico 1994, Philippines 1997), but loosening of credit in others (Sweden 1992, Korea 1997, Brazil 1999)."

832,"AB: Friedman's contribution to the consumption literature goes well beyond the seminal permanent-income hypothesis. He conjectured that the marginal propensity to consume out of financial wealth shall be larger than out of ""human wealth"", the present discounted value of future labor income. I present an explicitly solved model to deliver this widely noted consumption property by specifying that the conditional variance of changes in income increases with its level. A larger realization of income not only implies a higher level of human wealth, but also signals a riskier stream of future labor income, inducing a higher precautionary saving, and thus giving rise to Friedman's conjecture. Appropriately adjusting human wealth for income risk, I show that Friedman's conjecture may be formulated as a ""generalized"" permanent income hypothesis. I further show that Friedman's conjecture captures the first-order effect of stochastic precautionary savings. Finally, I propose a natural decomposition of the optimal saving rule to formalize various motives for holding wealth as emphasized in [Friedman, M., 1957. A Theory of the Consumption Function.

When agents believe productivity is high, they work, invest, and produce more. More production generates higher precision information. When the boom ends, precise estimates of the slowdown prompt decisive reactions: investment and labor fall sharply. When growth resumes, low production yields noisy estimates of recovery. Noise impedes learning, slows recovery, and makes booms more gradual than downturns. A calibrated model generates growth rate asymmetry similar to macroeconomic aggregates. Fluctuations in agents' forecast precision match observed countercyclical errors of forecasters. ""There is, however, another characteristic of what we call the trade cycle that our explanation must cover, namely, the phenomenon of the crisis--the fact that the substitution of a downward for an upward tendency often takes place suddenly and violently, whereas there is, as a rule, no such sharp turning point when an upward is substituted for a downward tendency.""

This paper quantifies the importance of the public-finance motive for inflation in the presence of a tax-evading sector, the underground economy. The approach is motivated by the observation that the underground economy is especially large in poor countries. The analysis builds on a general equilibrium monetary model with two production sectors, where income in one of the sectors cannot be taxed. A benevolent government finances its budget using an optimal combination of the income tax rate and the inflation rate. The model is first calibrated to the U.S. economy and is then used for a cross-country simulation. The resulting relationships between the size of an underground economy, inflation rate, income tax rate and the share of seigniorage in the government revenue rationalize the cross-country data quantitatively well."

This paper shows: (i) even a small degree of non-separability of the utility function between consumption and real balances causes the Taylor rule to be much more likely to induce indeterminacy or E-instability if this rule responds not only to inflation but also to output or the output gap, (ii) differences among the three timings strongly alter conditions for the Taylor rule to ensure both determinacy and E-stability."

Each new generation of ex ante identical individuals is divided in equilibrium into workers and entrepreneurs. Workers save through financial intermediaries in the form of interest-bearing deposits and supply labor to entrepreneurs in a competitive labor market. Entrepreneurs borrow from financial intermediaries to finance projects which produce privately observed sequences of random returns. Each financial intermediary holds deposits from a large number of workers and operates a portfolio of dynamic contracts with different credit positions. We calibrate the model to the U.S. economy and find that dynamic contracting is very effective at mitigating the effects of private information. Moreover, restricting borrowers and lenders to use static (one-period) contracts with a costly monitoring technology has adverse effects both on the level of aggregate economic activity and on individual welfare unless monitoring costs are very small. Finally, the optimal provision of intertemporal incentives leads to increasing consumption inequality over time within generational cohorts as in U.S. data."

935,AB: Recent empirical research documents that the strong short-term relationship between U.S. monetary aggregates on one side and inflation and real output on the other has mostly disappeared since the early 1980s. Using the direct estimate of flows of U.S. dollars abroad we find that domestic money (currency corrected for the foreign holdings of dollars) contains valuable information about future movements of U.S. inflation and real output. Statistical evidence suggests that the Friedman-Schwartz stylized facts can be reestablished once the focus of analysis is back on the correct measure of domestic monetary aggregates.

953,"AB: In the standard new Keynesian framework, an optimizing policy maker does not face a trade-off between stabilizing the inflation rate and stabilizing the gap between actual output and output under flexible prices. An ad hoc, exogenous cost-push shock is typically added to the inflation equation to generate a meaningful policy problem. In this paper, we show that a cost-push shock arises endogenously when a cost channel for monetary policy is introduced into the new Keynesian model. A cost channel is present when firms' marginal cost depends directly on the nominal rate of interest. Besides providing empirical evidence for a cost channel, we explore its implications for optimal monetary policy. We show that its presence alters the optimal policy problem in important ways. For example, both the output gap and inflation are allowed to fluctuate in response to productivity and demand shocks under optimal monetary policy."

Journal of Monetary Economics 41, 27-38] have shown that when the probability of a run is small, the bank will offer a contract that admits a bank-run equilibrium. We show that, in this case, the bank will chose to hold an amount of liquid reserves exactly equal to what withdrawal demand will be if a run does not occur, precautionary or ""excess"" liquidity will not be held. This result allows us to show that when the cost of liquidating investment early is high, an increase in the probability of a run will lead the bank to invest less. However, when liquidation costs are moderate, the level of investment is increasing in the probability of a run."

985,"AB: This paper presents a model of financial and economic development which assumes the consumption of real resources by the financial sector. Financial development occurs endogenously as the economy reaches a critical threshold of economic development. Compared to financial autarky, financial intermediaries allocate savings, net of their costs of operation, to more productive investments. Whenever the technology financed by intermediaries is more capital-intensive than that operated in financial autarky, the growth effect of financial development is ambiguous. As a result, financial development may be unsustainable. However, when financial development is sustainable, the credit market becomes more competitive and more efficient over time, and this could eventually contribute to economic growth. Nonetheless, given monopolistic competition in the financial sector, the level of entry into the credit market is generally inefficient. For instance, with diminishing returns to specialisation, entrants might be too few at the early stages of economic development and too many later on."

The transition is analysed with adaptive learning, under which agents do not need to adjust instantaneously to the change, as with rational expectations (RE). Impulse response analysis reveals that the transition with learning is asymmetrically sensitive to the nature of the exogenous technological shock at the time of the reform. If the reform coincides with a negative shock, the transition to the new steady state is slow, whereas, if it coincides with a positive shock, it is approximately the same as the one predicted by RE. The results imply that cutting capital income taxes before or during a recession may not be an effective means for short-run fiscal stimulus."

By contrast to existing models of the business cycle emphasizing the role of animal spirits, we do not rely on the sink property of the equilibrium to generate indeterminacy. Hence, while our model does pretty well in accounting for the main features of US business cycles, it avoids several criticisms addressed to these former models, concerning either their dependence upon strongly increasing returns, too high markups, or their implication of countercyclical movements of consumption."

These consumers rationally choose to only sporadically update their information and re-compute their optimal consumption plans. In between updating dates, they remain inattentive. This behavior implies that news disperses slowly throughout the population, so events have a gradual and delayed effect on aggregate consumption. The model predicts that aggregate consumption adjusts slowly to shocks, and is able to explain the excess sensitivity and excess smoothness puzzles. In addition, individual consumption is sensitive to ordinary and unexpected past news, but it is not sensitive to extraordinary or predictable events. The model further predicts that some people rationally choose to not plan, live hand-to-mouth, and save less, while other people sporadically update their plans. The longer are these plans, the more they save. Evidence using U.S. aggregate and microeconomic data generally supports these predictions."

Under some monetary policy rules studied, the conditional expectation of default rates and sovereign risk premiums are constant, so movements in these variables always arrive as a surprise. Under other monetary regimes considered, the equilibrium default rate and the sovereign risk premium are serially correlated and therefore forecastable. The paper also studies the consequences of delaying default. It characterizes environments under which procrastinating on default is counterproductive."

Under ""the opportunistic approach to disinflation"" a central bank controls inflation aggressively when inflation is far from its target, but concentrates more on output stabilization when inflation is close to its target, allowing supply shocks and unforeseen fluctuations in aggregate demand to move inflation within a certain band. We use stochastic simulations of a small-scale rational expectations model to contrast the behavior of output and inflation under opportunistic and linear rules."

Our analysis identifies a new learning cost associated with reversing the interest rate. In a standard monetary model with forward-looking expectations, data uncertainty and parameter uncertainty, a policy that frequently reverses the interest rate makes learning the key parameters of the model more difficult. Optimal monetary policy internalises this learning cost and therefore has a lower number of interest rate reversals."

In this setup finance has an influence on both, the level of capital and the timing of investment. Finance and productivity are complements and finance influences investment the strongest when firms wish to significantly adjust capital for fundamental reasons. These theoretical considerations are confronted with UK data. While finance is mostly irrelevant for long-term capital decision, the short-run investment function shows a significant impact of finance, which is also strongest for strong fundamental investment incentives."

1233,"AB: In this paper, we consider estimation of a time-varying parameter model for a forward-looking monetary policy rule, by employing ex post data. A Heckman-type (1976. The common structure of statistical models of truncation, sample selection, and limited dependent variables and a simple estimator for such models. Annals of Economic and Social Measurement 5, 475-492) two-step procedure is employed in order to deal with endogeneity in the regressors. This allows us to econometrically take into account changing degrees of uncertainty associated with the Fed's forecasts of future inflation and GDP gap when estimating the model. Even though such uncertainty does not enter the model directly, we achieve efficiency in estimation by employing the standardized prediction errors for inflation and GDP gap as bias correction terms in the second-step regression. We note that no other empirical literature on monetary policy deals with this important issue. Our empirical results also reveal new aspects not found in the literature previously. That is, the history of the Fed's conduct of monetary policy since the early 1970s can in general be divided into three subperiods: the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. The conventional division of the sample into pre-Volcker and Volcker-Greenspan periods could mislead the empirical assessment of monetary policy."

This paper reconsiders the question of the revenue maximizing inflation rate in a general equilibrium framework with a labor-leisure choice, where money is held because it reduces transactions costs. In this framework, the revenue maximizing inflation tax rate is lower than that implied by Cagan's rule."

Today, richer countries exhibit higher price levels than poorer countries, a stylized fact usually attributed to the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effect. But looking back 50 years, this effect virtually disappears from the data. What is often assumed to be a universal property is actually quite specific to recent times, emerging a half century ago and growing steadily over time. What might potentially explain this historical pattern? We develop an updated BS model inspired by recent developments in trade theory, where a continuum of goods are differentiated by productivity, and where tradability is endogenously determined. Firms experiencing productivity gains are more likely to become tradable and crowd out firms not experiencing productivity gains. As a result the usual BS assumption--that productivity gains be concentrated in the traded goods sector--emerges endogenously, and the BS effect on relative price levels likewise evolves gradually over time."

1331,"AB: This paper establishes the existence of equilibria for environments in which outside money is issued competitively. Such equilibria are typically believed not to exist because of a classic overissue problem: if money is valued in equilibrium, an issuer produces money until its value is driven to zero. By backward induction, money cannot have value in the first place. This paper shows that overissuance is not a problem if agents believe that if an issuer produces more than some threshold number of notes, then only those notes issued up to the threshold will be valued, additional notes will be worthless. This result is very general, applying to any monetary economy in which equilibria with and without valued money exist if the money supply is finite. The paper also compares the allocation achieved by a monopolist to that achieved with competitive issuance in both a search and an overlapping-generations environment. The results depend on the environment considered, but two general conclusions arise. First, it is ambiguous whether competitive issuers can achieve a more desirable allocation than a monopolist. Second, with competitive issuance, a licensing agency can always improve on pure laissez-faire and achieve the efficient allocation in the long run."

Based on new data from more than 2500 firms across 37 countries, this paper provides the first empirical assessment of the impact of different bank supervisory policies on firms' financing obstacles. We find that the traditional approach to bank supervision, which involves empowering official supervisory agencies to monitor, discipline, and influence banks directly, does not improve the integrity of bank lending. Rather, we find that a supervisory strategy that focuses on empowering private monitoring of banks by forcing banks to disclose accurate information to the private sector tends to lower the degree to which corruption of bank officials is an obstacle to firms raising external finance. In extensions, we find that regulations that empower private monitoring exert a particularly beneficial effect on the integrity of bank lending in countries with sound legal institutions."

The contribution of this paper is both to expand the set of mechanisms leading to multiple natural rates of unemployment and to establish a minimum set of assumptions under which such multiplicity may arise. To this aim, a search-matching model is presented where households allocate time to market and non-market activities, and invest both in physical and human capital. It is shown that under the standard assumption of concavity in production and matching such a model yields multiple long-run equilibria with different rates of unemployment. This result does not rely on labor-market institutions or increasing returns to scale. Multiplicity in our model arises from differences in the intensity of use of human capital across time-consuming activities."

1460,"AB: We examine the international transmission of business cycles in a two-country model where credit contracts are imperfectly enforceable. In our economy, foreign lenders differ from domestic lenders in their ability to recover value from borrowers' assets and, therefore, to protect themselves against contractual non-enforceability. The relative importance of domestic and foreign credit frictions changes over the cycle. This induces entrepreneurs to adjust their debt exposure and allocation of collateral between domestic and foreign lenders in response to exogenous productivity shocks. We show that such a model can explain the comovement of output across countries."

1475,"AB: By focusing on observable default risk's role in loan terms and the subsequent consequences for household behavior, this paper shows that lenders increasingly used risk-based pricing of interest rates in consumer loan markets during the mid-1990s. It tests three resulting predictions: First, the premium paid per unit of risk should have increased over this period. Second, debt levels should have reacted accordingly. Third, fewer high-risk households should have been denied credit, further contributing to the interest rate spread between the highest- and lowest-risk borrowers. For people obtaining loans, the premium paid per unit of risk did indeed become significantly larger after the mid-1990s. For example, for a 0.01 increase in the probability of bankruptcy, the corresponding interest-rate increase tripled for first mortgages, doubled for automobile loans and rose nearly six-fold for second mortgages. Additionally, changes in borrowing levels and debt access reflected these new pricing practices, particularly for secured debt. Borrowing increased most for the low-risk households who saw their relative borrowing costs fall. Furthermore, while very high-risk households gained expanded access to credit, the increases in their risk premiums implied that their borrowing as a whole either rose less or, sometimes, fell."

1493,"AB: This paper examines the extent to which the process of globalization can explain the observed widening in the cross-country distribution of output-per-worker. On the theoretical front the model highlights why, when the labor market is subject to a holdup problem, the opening up of trade will cause an increase in the dispersion of income across countries similar to that observed in the data. The increase in dispersion in the model arises due to the emergence of a discrepancy between the private and social returns to capital accumulation that favors capital abundant countries. On the empirical front, we document the relevance of the model by examining whether growth patterns, decomposition exercises and specialization patterns support the model's predictions. Overall we find that over 50% of the recently observed increase in income dispersion across countries can be accounted for by the mechanism exemplified by the model."

Our results lend support to recent heterogeneous-firm models of international trade that predict a reallocation of economic activity towards high-productivity firms as trade costs fall. We find that industries experiencing relatively large declines in trade costs exhibit relatively strong productivity growth. We also find that low-productivity plants in industries with falling trade costs are more likely to die, that relatively high-productivity non-exporters are more likely to start exporting in response to falling trade costs, and that existing exporters increase their shipments abroad as trade costs fall. Finally, we provide evidence of productivity growth within firms in response to decreases in industry-level trade costs."

1561,"AB: China in the past few years has emerged as a net foreign creditor on the international scene with net foreign assets (NFAs) slightly greater than 0% of wealth. This is surprising given that China is a relatively poor country with a capital-labor ratio about one-fifth the world average and one-tenth the US level. We ask whether it makes economic sense for China to be a net creditor and what China's NFA position might be in 20 years. We calibrate a theoretical model of international capital flows featuring diminishing returns, production risk, and sovereign risk. Our calibrations for China yield a predicted NFA position of -17% of China's wealth. We also estimate non-structural cross-country regressions of determinants of NFAs in which China is always a significant outlier with around 9% points more of NFAs relative to wealth than is predicted by its characteristics. We speculate that a variety of domestic distortions account for these deviations from the theory and cross-country empirics. We calibrate and predict different--and necessarily speculative--scenarios out to 2025, assuming that China's NFA position eventually conforms with the theoretical and cross-country regularities. Our scenarios suggest a future negative NFA position between 3% and 9% of wealth. Starting from China's zero NFA position, it would take current account deficits in the range of 2-5% of GDP to reach any of these future NFA positions. These are not unreasonable deficits, but they would require a large adjustment from the present 6% of GDP current account surplus."

While the importance of services rather than manufacturing has been widely noted, within manufacturing India has emphasized skill-intensive rather than labor-intensive manufacturing, and industries with higher-than-average scale (though average firm size within industries is unusually small). Some of these distinctive patterns existed prior to the beginning of economic reforms in the 1980s, and stem from the idiosyncratic policies adopted after India's independence. These patterns have not changed despite reforms that have removed some policy impediments that contributed to India's distinctive path. We discuss the implications for India's future growth."

Even with important gaps in the data, the empirical literature is able to conclude that offshore outsourcing is unlikely to have accounted for a meaningful part of the job losses in the recent downturn or contributed much to the slow labor market rebound. The empirical evidence to date, while still tentative, actually suggests that increased employment in the overseas affiliates of US multinationals is associated with more employment in the US parent rather than less."

The general equilibrium is characterized by a closed-form recursion in the CARA-normal case. Incomplete markets introduce a risk premium on private equity, which reduces the demand for investment. As compared to complete markets, the steady state can thus have both a lower capital stock due to investment risk, and a lower interest rate due to precautionary savings. Furthermore, the anticipation of high real interest rates in the future feeds back into high risk premia and low investment in the present, thus slowing down convergence to the steady state. Our results highlight the importance of private risk premia for capital accumulation and business cycles."

This paper shows that when credit market distortions arise from adverse selection they sometimes stabilize the economy rather than destabilize it. The stabilizing forces are closely related to forces that cause overinvestment in static models. When investment projects are equity financed, or when contracts are written optimally, the distortions always stabilize the economy. Thus, stabilizing equilibria are a robust feature of the model. The empirical distinction between accelerator and stabilizer equilibria is subtle. Many empirical tests are unable to distinguish between accelerator and stabilizer equilibria."

Our estimated monetary policy shocks are closely correlated with typically estimated measures. The impulse response functions are broadly similar across estimation methods.

1731,"AB: The idea that the investment process takes time to produce finished capital goods was an integral part of Kydland and Prescott's early work on real business cycles, but this feature has been dropped in much recent work, mainly because it seemed to have little effect on macroeconomic dynamics. With a generalization of the ""time-to-build"" feature that incorporates multiple types of capital, however, a New Keynesian model can produce ""u-shaped"" responses in output, investment, and inflation to a monetary policy shock. Such responses are not found in many studies that assume no time-to-build friction. In addition, different specifications of the time-to-build structure result in substantially different response patterns for these aggregate variables."

1747,"AB: This paper evaluates reserves regimes versus interest rate corridors, which have become competing frameworks for monetary policy implementation. Rate corridors, relying on lending and deposit facilities to create ceilings and floors for overnight interest rates, evince mixed results on controlling volatility. Reserve requirements allow period-average smoothing of interest rates but, even if remunerated, are subject to reserve avoidance activities. A system of voluntary, period-average reserve commitments could offer equivalent rate-smoothing advantages. If central banks created symmetric opportunity costs of meeting or falling short of period-average reserve requirements (or commitments), they could achieve flat reserve demand on settlement day."

Agents' learning evolves from private experiences and we explore how the formation of prices interacts with learning. We show that multiple equilibria arise, and equilibria with price dispersion entail more learning than equilibria with one price. Price dispersion increases communication about private histories, which in turn increases the overall amount of information in the economy. We also compare ex ante welfare under price dispersion and one price. Our results show that, despite the existence of some meetings where no trade takes place, ex ante welfare under price dispersion may be higher than under one price."

This specification consists in augmenting a standard VAR with two forward-looking variables: the federal funds futures rate (or alternatively a money market forward rate) reflecting monetary policy expectations and a composite leading indicator of economic activity. These two variables appear to effectively control for the information set that the Federal Reserve may use in monetary policy decision-making. With this modification, theory-consistent responses to monetary policy shocks are obtained."

I find little evidence that their relative position deteriorated over the period. By some indicators, this generation has seen an improvement. In terms of income, the 40-55 age group was at about the same relative position in 2001 as in 1983. In terms of conventional wealth, there was some slippage over the period. In terms of mean augmented wealth (net worth plus pension and Social Security wealth), their relative position improved somewhat but in terms of median augmented wealth there was again some slippage."

44,"AB: This paper employs a multi-country large-scale Overlapping Generations model with uninsurable labor productivity and mortality risk to quantify the impact of the demographic transition towards an older population in industrialized countries on world-wide rates of return, international capital flows and the distribution of wealth and welfare in the OECD. We find that for the U.S. as an open economy, rates of return are predicted to decline by 86 basis points between 2005 and 2080 and wages increase by about 4.1%. If the U.S. were a closed economy, rates of return would decline and wages increase by less. This is due to the fact that other regions in the OECD will age even more rapidly, therefore the U.S. is ""importing"" the more severe demographic transition from the rest of the OECD in the form of larger factor price changes. In terms of welfare, our model suggests that young agents with little assets and currently low labor productivity gain, up to 1% in consumption, from higher wages associated with population aging. Older, asset-rich households tend to lose, because of the predicted decline in real returns to capital."

In many countries, however, retirement incentives in social security programs prevent retirement ages from keeping pace with changes in life expectancy, leading to an increased need for life-cycle savings. Analyzing a cross-country panel of macroeconomic data, we find that increased longevity raises aggregate savings rates in countries with universal pension coverage and retirement incentives, though the effect disappears in countries with pay-as-you-go systems and high replacement rates."

112,"AB: In this paper we ask whether an aspect of social security, namely its role as a provider of insurance against uncertain life spans, is welfare enhancing. To this end we use an OLG model where agents have a bequest motive and differ in sex and marital status and where families are formed and destroyed and their characteristics evolve (exogenously) according to U.S. demographic patterns of marriage, divorce, fertility and mortality. We compare the implications of social security under a variety of market structures that differ in the extent to which life insurance and annuities are available. We find that social security is a bad idea. In economies where the private sector provides annuities and life insurance, it is a bad idea for the standard reason that it distorts the intertemporal margin by lowering the capital stock. In the absence of such securities social security is still a very bad idea, only marginally less so compared with economies with annuities and life insurance. We also explore these issues in a world where people live longer and we find no differences in our answers. As a by-product of our analysis we find that the existence of life insurance opportunities for people is important in welfare terms while that of annuities is not."

147,"AB: How sustainable are the current social security systems in the developed economies, given the projected demographic trends? The most recent literature has answered this question through dynamic general-equilibrium models in a closed-economy framework. This paper provides a new quantitative benchmark of analysis for this question represented by a two-region model (South and North) of the world economy where capital flows across regions. The timing and the extent of the demographic transition--and the associated economic forces shaping capital accumulation and equilibrium factor prices--are very different in the two regions. Thus, the projected paths of interest rate and wage rate in the North diverge substantially between closed and open economy. We perform a wide range of policy experiments under both scenarios. Our main conclusion is that if one is interested in quantifying the path of the fiscal variables (e.g., the value of the payroll tax) needed to keep the social security system viable or to finance a transition towards a fully funded system, then these two benchmarks yield similar results. However, if the focus is on quantifying the path of factor prices, aggregate variables and, ultimately, welfare, then the two approaches can diverge significantly."

215,"AB: Housing is a major component of wealth. Since house prices fluctuate considerably over time, it is important to understand how these fluctuations affect households' consumption decisions. Rising house prices may stimulate consumption by increasing households' perceived wealth, or by relaxing borrowing constraints. This paper investigates the response of household consumption to house prices using UK micro data. We estimate the largest effect of house prices on consumption for older homeowners, and the smallest effect, insignificantly different from zero, for younger renters. This finding is consistent with heterogeneity in the wealth effect across these groups. In addition, we find that regional house prices affect regional consumption growth. Predictable changes in house prices are correlated with predictable changes in consumption, particularly for households that are more likely to be borrowing constrained, but this effect is driven by national rather than regional house prices and is important for renters as well as homeowners, suggesting that UK house prices are correlated with aggregate financial market conditions."

233,"AB: We analyze the role of risk aversion and intertemporal substitution in a simple dynamic general equilibrium model of investment and savings. Our main finding is that risk aversion cannot by itself explain a negative relationship between aggregate investment and aggregate uncertainty, as the effect of increased uncertainty on investment also depends on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. In particular, the relationship between aggregate investment and aggregate uncertainty is positive even if agents are very risk averse, as long as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is low. A negative investment-uncertainty relationship requires that the relative risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution are both relatively high or both relatively low. We also show that the implications of our model are consistent with the available empirical evidence."

In the absence of full-commitment, it is well known that debt restructuring cannot solve the time-inconsistency problem for economies with a private stock of capital. We re-examine this result by exploring the role of institutional delays in government policies. We show that, when the implementation of government policy requires time, debt restructuring can enforce commitment to the optimal capital taxes. We conclude that, since institutional delays characterize democratic decision making, the time-inconsistency problem of capital taxes is not so severe."

In particular, it fails to generate the negative correlation between vacancies and unemployment in the data, i.e., the Beveridge curve. Introducing real wage rigidity leads to a negative correlation, and increases the magnitude of labor market flows to more realistic values. However, inflation dynamics are only weakly affected by real wage rigidity. The reason is that labor market frictions give rise to long-run employment relationships. The measure of real marginal costs that is relevant for inflation in the Phillips curve contains a present value component that varies independently of the real wage."

317,"AB: Ignoring the existence of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates one considerably understates the value of monetary commitment in New Keynesian models. A stochastic forward-looking model with an occasionally binding lower bound, calibrated to the U.S. economy, suggests that low values for the natural rate of interest lead to sizeable output losses and deflation under discretionary monetary policy. The fall in output and deflation are much larger than in the case with policy commitment and do not show up at all if the model abstracts from the existence of the lower bound. The welfare losses of discretionary policy increase even further when inflation is partly determined by lagged inflation in the Phillips curve. These results emerge because private sector expectations and the discretionary policy response to these expectations reinforce each other and cause the lower bound to be reached much earlier than under commitment."

335,"AB: We revisit a foundational theoretical paper in the menu-cost literature, Sheshinski and Weiss [1983. Optimum pricing policy under stochastic inflation. Review of Economic Studies 50(3), 513-529], one of the few to treat stochastic inflation with persistent deviations from trend. In contrast to the original finding, we show that optimal pricing in this environment entails using different (s,S) bands in high-inflation and low-inflation states of the world. The low-inflation band is strictly contained within the high-inflation band. This revised solution has very different implications from the original one. Firms are generally risk loving, not risk averse, with respect to inflation. An increase in the variance of inflation increases price dispersion when inflation is high and decreases price dispersion when inflation is low. On an aggregate level, this optimal pricing would lead to bunching of prices and non-neutrality of money in the setting of Caplin and Spulber [1987. Menu costs and the neutrality of money. Quarterly Journal of Economics 102(4), 703-725]. To test the main finding, we construct an establishment-level dataset from the months surrounding Mexico's ""tequila crisis"" in 1995. In the high-inflation state, price increases are larger and establishments allow their prices to vary more widely around their respective long-run mean relative prices. Cross-establishment price dispersion is lower, but this result seems due to decreased establishment heterogeneity rather than narrower (s,S) bands. Overall, the evidence suggests that establishments employ wider (s,S) bands in the high-inflation state."

Optimal labor taxes are driven by: (i) a term reflecting Ramsey considerations which makes labor taxes vary positively with employment and (ii) a martingale component, reflecting the excess burden of tax, which shows persistent responses to shocks to the government's intertemporal budget constraint. Under complete markets (when governments can issue a full set of contingent securities) only the first factor is relevant. We find substantial evidence that incorporating incomplete markets into the optimal taxation model is critical for empirical success. However, we find strongest support for the martingale component and only weak evidence for the Ramsey component."

493,"AB: Payment, fundamental to exchange in a decentralized economy, often takes the form of transfers of inside money, i.e., specialized forms of debt. Associated with each type of inside money is a set of rules that governs both the legitimacy of such transfers as means of extinguishing other debts, and the allocation of the ensuing risks. In this paper we develop a model of debt as inside money. In a simple mechanism design framework we show that transferable debt that can be used to settle other debt obligations with finality can be a welfare improving arrangement in the presence of limited enforcement powers. Transferable debt has two advantages over simple chains of credit: it allows for removal of less-than-perfectly reliable agents from the chain in a timely fashion, and it allows agents to direct payments to the proper party without direct communication with other members of the credit chain."

As in random matching models, a commodity or fiat object can endogenously become money, but the details are richer and conform better with evidence: any commodity can be money, the ""best"" commodity is the most likely money, fiat money can totally crowd out commodity money in an asymmetric environment, going shopping is more likely than door-to-door sales.

We perform posterior odds tests to investigate the hypothesis whether central banks do target exchange rates. The main result of this paper is that the central banks of Australia and New Zealand do not, whereas the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England do include the nominal exchange rate in its policy rule. This result is robust for various specification of the policy rule. We also find that terms-of-trade movements do not contribute significantly to domestic business cycles."

645,"AB: The recent literature on monetary policy design has emphasized the importance of equilibrium determinacy and learnability in the choice of policy rules. This paper contains an analysis of the learnability of the equilibrium in a class of simple, micro-founded models in which the policy authority uses a Taylor-type monetary policy rule. Unlike previous analyses, the model economy is not linearized about a steady state--instead, a global perspective is adopted. Globally, the nonlinear model economy can possess rational expectations equilibria other than the steady state consistent with the inflation target of the monetary authorities. These include a second, low inflation 'liquidity trap' steady state, periodic equilibria, and sunspot equilibria. The main results in the paper characterize the conditions under which these alternative equilibria maybe stable under adaptive learning, even when the policy rule obeys the Taylor principle. The stability of multiple equilibria is associated with policy rules which are forecast-based. An important finding is that backward-looking Taylor-type policy rules can guarantee that the unique learnable equilibrium is the steady state associated with the inflation target of the monetary authority."

661,"AB: The Fed kept interest rates low and essentially unchanged during the late 1990s despite a booming economy and record-low unemployment. These interest rates were accommodative by historical standards. Nonetheless, inflation remained low. How did the Fed succeed in sustaining rapid economic growth without fueling inflation and inflationary expectations? In retrospect, it is evident that the productive capacity of the economy increased. Yet as events unfolded, there was uncertainty about the expansion of the capacity of the economy and therefore about the sustainability of the Fed's policy. This paper provides an explanation for the success of the Fed in accommodating growth with stable inflation in the late 1990s. It shows that if the central bank is committed to reverse policy errors it makes because of unwarranted optimism, inflation can remain in check even if the central bank keeps interest rates low because of this optimism. In particular, a price level target--which is a simple way to model a commitment to offset errors--can serve to anchor inflation even if the public does not share the central bank's optimism about shifts in potential output. The paper shows that price level targeting is superior to inflation targeting in a wide range of situations. The paper also provides econometric evidence that, in contrast to earlier periods, the Fed has recently put substantial weight on the price level in setting interest rates. Moreover, it shows that CPI announcement surprises lead to reversion in the price level. Finally, it provides textual evidence that Alan Greenspan puts relatively more weight on the price level than inflation."

We also investigate several methods of combining forecasts.

What they call investment-specific technological change is shown to be closely related to the more familiar concept of total factor productivity (TFP) growth: statements about the one can be translated into statements about the other.

These banks face the same marginal cost of funds due to internal capital markets, but face different borrowers as they concentrate their lending with small local businesses. Exploring cross-sectional variation in local economic conditions across these subsidiaries, we investigate whether borrower creditworthiness influences the response of bank lending to monetary policy. Our results are consistent with a demand-driven transmission mechanism that works through firm balance sheets and is independent from the bank lending channel."

This is because, with standard preferences, savings are highly persistent even when risky income is not. In the calibrated model, the first order autocorrelation of savings is an order of magnitude larger than that of income."

We find significant effects operating through the tax on realized nominal capital gains. A tax on nominal bond income magnifies these effects. Our innovation is to combine monetary policy shocks with non-indexed taxes in a model where the central bank implements policy using an interest rate rule. Monetary policy had important effects on the behavior of the business cycle before 1980 because policymakers did not exert effective control over inflation. Monetary policy reform around 1980 led to better control, and with more stable inflation, the effect of the interaction between monetary policy and the nominal capital gains tax has become negligible."

In this paper, we draw on growth theory to identify variables other than productivity--namely consumption and labor compensation--to help estimate trend productivity growth. We treat that trend as a common factor with two ""regimes,"" high- and low-growth. Our analysis picks up striking evidence of a return in 1997 to the high-growth regime, nearly 25 years after a switch from high- to low-growth. We find that both the common factor and regime-switching aspects of the model are important for identifying changes in trend productivity, and also show that the trend breaks are more difficult to detect with per capita (as opposed to per hour) based data because of persistent labor supply shifts. Finally, we argue that our methodology is effective in detecting changes in trend in real time: In the case of the 1990s, the methodology would have signaled the regime switch by 1999, or within roughly six quarters of when it occurred according to the full sample."

Optimal monetary policy features a muted response to output. Interest-rate rules that feature a positive response to output can lead to significant welfare losses.

Banks with higher probability of financial distress manage their interest rate risk more aggressively, both by means of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments. As compared to the derivative users, the derivative non-user banks adopt conservative asset-liability management policies in tighter monetary policy regimes. Finally, I show that the derivative non-user bank's lending volume declines significantly with the contraction in the money supply. Derivative users, on the other hand, remain immune to the monetary policy shocks. My findings suggest that a potential benefit of derivatives usage is to minimize the effect of external shocks on a firm's operating policies."

The effect operates through the Fisher relationship: a smoother profile of consumption implies a more persistent real interest rate, which in turn implies persistent optimal inflation. Our work complements a recent strand of the Ramsey literature based on models with nominal rigidities. In these latter models, inflation volatility is lower than in the baseline model but continues to exhibit little persistence. We quantify the effects of habit and capital on inflation persistence and also relate our findings to recent work on optimal fiscal policy with incomplete markets."

While previous explanations emphasized production complementarity, our analysis explores complementarity in information acquisition. Because information about future productivity has a high fixed cost of production and a low marginal cost of replication, sectors can share the cost of acquiring aggregate information, rather than each paying the full production cost to forecast their sector-specific productivity. Sectors with common, aggregate information make highly correlated production choices. By filtering out sector-specific shocks and transmitting aggregate ones, information markets amplify business-cycle comovement."

1126,"AB: What is the relation between infrequent price adjustment and the dynamic response of the aggregate price level to monetary shocks? The answer to this question ranges from a one-to-one link [Calvo, G., 1983. Prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 383-398] to no connection whatsoever [Caplin, A., Spulber, D., 1987. Menu costs and the neutrality of money. Quarterly Journal of Economics 102, 703-726]. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified framework to understand the mechanisms behind this wide range of results. In doing so, we propose new interpretations of key results in this area, which in turn suggest the kind of Ss model that is likely to generate substantial price rigidity. Among these new interpretations, we revisit Caplin and Spulber's monetary neutrality result. We show that when price stickiness is measured in terms of the impulse response function, this result is not a consequence of aggregation, as is often assumed, but is due instead to the absence of price stickiness at the microeconomic level. We also show that the ""selection effect,"" according to which units that adjust their prices are those that benefit the most, is neither necessary nor sufficient to account for the higher aggregate flexibility of Ss-type models compared to Calvo models. Instead, the key concept is the contribution of the extensive margin of adjustment to the aggregate price response. The aggregate price level is more flexible than suggested by the microeconomic frequency of adjustment if and only if this term is positive."

1142,"AB: In this paper, I consider the policy implications of two alternative structural interpretations of observed inflation persistence, which correspond to two alternative specifications of the new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC). The first specification allows for some degree of intrinsic persistence by way of a lagged inflation term in the NKPC. The second is a purely forward-looking model, in which expectations farther into the future matter and coefficients are time-varying. In this specification, most of the observed inflation persistence is attributed to fluctuations in the underlying inflation trend, which are a consequence of monetary policy rather than a structural feature of the economy. With a simple quantitative exercise, I illustrate the consequences of implementing monetary policy, assuming a degree of intrinsic persistence that differs from the true one. The results suggest that the costs of implementing a stabilization policy when the policymaker overestimates the degree of intrinsic persistence are potentially higher than the costs of ignoring actual structural persistence, the result is more clear-cut when the policymaker minimizes a welfare-based loss function."

The endogeneity of contract duration has a dramatic impact on the magnitude of the aggregate effects of steady-state inflation. With a plausible calibration of the magnitude of menu costs and other structural parameters, this model predicts a relationship between steady-state inflation and the frequency of price adjustment that is reasonably close to the empirical findings of cross-country studies. Furthermore, at moderate inflation rates, steady-state inflation generates relative price distortions that have a non-trivial impact on aggregate output, but this impact wanes and eventually disappears at much higher annual inflation rates because the frequency of price adjustment approaches that of the flexible-price economy."

1238,"AB: We examine the performance and robustness properties of monetary policy rules in an estimated macroeconomic model in which the economy undergoes structural change and where private agents and the central bank possess imperfect knowledge about the true structure of the economy. Policymakers follow an interest rate rule aiming to maintain price stability and to minimize fluctuations of unemployment around its natural rate but are uncertain about the economy's natural rates of interest and unemployment and how private agents form expectations. In particular, we consider two models of expectations formation: rational expectations (RE) and learning. We show that in this environment the ability to stabilize the real side of the economy is significantly reduced relative to an economy under RE with perfect knowledge. Furthermore, policies that would be optimal under perfect knowledge can perform very poorly if knowledge is imperfect. Efficient policies that take account of private learning and misperceptions of natural rates call for greater policy inertia, a more aggressive response to inflation, and a smaller response to the perceived unemployment gap than would be optimal if everyone had perfect knowledge of the economy. We show that such policies are quite robust to potential misspecification of private sector learning and the magnitude of variation in natural rates."

The usefulness of monetary analysis is contrasted to weaknesses in modeling monetary policy and inflation with respectively short-term interest rates and real activity measures. The analysis sheds light on the recent change in inflation volatility and persistence as well as on the Phillips curve flattening, and reveals drawbacks in pursuing a low inflation target without considering monetary aggregates."

1305,"AB: The paper reconsiders the role of money and banking in monetary policy analysis by including a banking sector and money in an optimizing model otherwise of a standard type. The model is implemented quantitatively, with a calibration based on US data. It is reasonably successful in providing an endogenous explanation for substantial steady-state differentials between the interbank policy rate and (i) the collateralized loan rate, (ii) the uncollateralized loan rate, (iii) the T-bill rate, (iv) the net marginal product of capital, and (v) a pure intertemporal rate. We find a differential of over 3% p.a. between (iii) and (iv), thereby contributing to resolution of the equity premium puzzle. Dynamic impulse response functions imply pro- or counter-cyclical movements in an external finance premium that can be of quantitative significance. In addition, they suggest that a central bank that fails to recognize the distinction between interbank and other short rates could miss its appropriate settings by as much as 4% p.a. Also, shocks to banking productivity or collateral effectiveness call for large responses in the policy rate."

Then, using the coefficients of the empirical model, the deviation of the actual real exchange rate from its equilibrium values is estimated. Although the estimates differ with the chosen method for approximation of the fundamentals, it seems that the overvaluation of the real exchange rate does not pose serious problems for the policy makers in Macedonia. Finally, the estimation of the short-run empirical model implies slow adjustment of the actual real exchange rate to the long-run equilibrium level."

Several of the most important dividend theories were employed to test the behaviour of Greek individual investors towards dividends. The results reveal strong evidence that individual investors in Greece want dividends. Their answers provide strong support for the signalling theory of Bhattacharya (1979), while the behavioural finance theory of Shefrin and Statman (1984) is marginally confirmed."

The 'Goldilocks' argument states that if there are values that are clearly too high and too low, there must be an intrinsic value between the two that is just right. The 'time-will tell' argument states that however unstable prices may be in the short-run, in the long-run we can infer an intrinsic value beneath them."

The system failed to satisfy a purported arbitrage condition: the yield on collateral exceeded the tax rate plus the product of the clearing fee and the average clearing rate of notes. The failure is explained by a model in which note issuers choose to issue notes only in trades that produce a low clearing rate (high float), but in which there are diminishing returns to additional note issue."

Using a general-equilibrium overlapping-generations model with realistic patterns of fertility and lifespan extension, this study shows that future generations would be harmed during the demographic transition due to rising payroll taxes, which crowd out savings and slow real wage growth below the rate of technological progress. A faster rate of technological progress would mitigate only some of the payroll tax increase and its economic consequences but could not overcome them. Addressing the financing problem by reducing Social Security benefits as needed or by raising the eligibility age for benefits imposes major welfare losses on current or near term retirees. By contrast, a pre-funding of Social Security financed with consumption taxes more evenly spreads the welfare losses across generations, and it helps future generations, especially the poor, by stimulating capital formation."

Firms' inattentiveness gives rise to idiosyncratic information errors and imperfect common knowledge about the shocks hitting the economy. This is shown to have strong implications for optimal nominal demand policy. In particular, if firms' prices are strategic complements and economic shocks display little persistence, monetary policy has strong real effects, making it optimal to stabilize the output gap. Weak complementarities or sufficient shock persistence, however, cause price level stabilization to become increasingly optimal. With persistent shocks, optimal monetary policy shifts from output gap stabilization in initial periods following the shock to price level stabilization in later periods, potentially rationalizing the medium-term approach to price stability adopted by some central banks."

The monetary policy authority is assumed to formulate optimal commitment plans, to be tempted to renege on them, and to succumb to this temptation with a constant exogenous probability known to the private sector. By interpreting this probability as a continuous measure of the (lack of) credibility of the monetary policy authority, we investigate the welfare effect of a marginal increase in credibility. Our main finding is that, in a simple model of the monetary transmission mechanism, most of the gains from commitment accrue at relatively low levels of credibility."

I show that fixed exchange rates with a Central Bank providing liquidity in local currency imply Pareto efficiency, with conditions for a run equilibrium stronger than in the literature. In a flexible exchange rate regime, multiple equilibria may not be eliminated. In particular, for very a expansive monetary policy there exists an equilibrium where a fraction of patient consumers purchases dollars in the interim period, which constitutes a partial currency run. A dollarized banking system without international short-run credit may also implement the efficient allocation under certain conditions."

Asset pricing with heterogeneous consumers. Journal of Political Economy 104, 219-237]. We implement the new kernel on household consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). At monthly and quarterly horizons, the new kernel reconciles the premium on U.S. equities with the consumption of asset holders, for reasonable values of relative risk aversion. The new kernel also fares better than kernels based on the aggregation of intertemporal marginal rates of substitution in explaining the cross-sectional variation of risk premia on stocks and bonds. Portfolios mimicking changes in the cross-sectional variance of log consumption for asset holders command significant negative Sharpe ratios."

The evidence suggests that, prior to 1979, the Fed accommodated temporary shocks to expected inflation, which then led to persistent increases in actual inflation. We do not find this behavior in the post-1979 data. Among commonly cited factors, oil and fiscal shocks do not appear to have triggered an increase in expected inflation that eventually resulted in higher actual inflation."

The gap estimates are large and persistent even after allowing for correlated trend and cycle shock. We then augment our model to use the information in the unemployment rate. The estimates confirm the presence of a large and persistent cyclical component."

These restrictions are consistent with the implications of a popular class of DSGE models, with both real and nominal frictions, and with sufficiently wide ranges for their parameters. This identification strategy thus substitutes theoretically motivated restrictions for the atheoretical assumptions on the time-series properties of the data that are key to long-run restrictions. Stochastic technology improvements persistently increase real wages, consumption, investment and output in the data, hours worked are very likely to increase, displaying a hump-shaped pattern. Contrary to most of the related VAR evidence, results are not sensitive to a number of specification assumptions, including those on the stationarity properties of variables."

These movements, in turn, can be related to variables associated with labor-market search theory, including unemployment benefits, labor productivity, real wages, and sectoral shifts in the labor market. There is also a strong negative relationship between inflation and the corresponding measure of cyclical unemployment, supporting the existence of a short-run Phillips curve."

Such tests are incapable of rejecting sustainability. The intertemporal budget constraint proves to be satisfied if either the debt series or the revenue and with-interest spending series are integrated of arbitrarily high order, i.e., stationary after differencing arbitrarily often. Revenues and spending do not have to be cointegrated. Rejections of low-order difference-stationarity and of cointegration are thus consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint. Error-correction-type policy reaction functions are suggested as more promising for understanding deficit problems."

1745,AB: Standard macroeconomic models equate the money market rate targeted by the central bank with the interest rate implied by a consumption Euler equation. We use U.S. data to calculate the interest rates implied by Euler equations derived from a number of specifications of household preferences. Correlations between these Euler equation rates and the Federal Funds rate are generally negative. Regression results and impulse response functions imply that the spreads between the Euler equation rates and the Federal Funds rate are systematically linked to the stance of monetary policy. Our findings pose a fundamental challenge for models that equate the two.

Finally, I provide a complete characterization for the equilibrium cross-sectional distribution of wealth and income in closed form by developing a recursive formulation for the moments of the distribution of wealth and income. Using this recursive formulation, I show that income persistence and the degree of wealth mean reversion are the main determinants of wealth-income correlation and relative dispersions of wealth to income, such as skewness and kurtosis ratios between wealth and income."

A market arises at the repayment stage and generates information-revealing prices that perfectly discipline the bank. This mechanism also applies when there exist multiple banks. With multiple banks, competition of private monies improves welfare. A prohibition on private money issue not only eliminates money competition but also triggers free-rider problems among banks, which is detrimental to welfare."

Productive activity and matching in the goods market are endogenized by a time allocation decision of work and search effort. We find that a high degree of complementarity between participation in the labor and goods markets creates a channel by which inflation can positively influence production and output. This feature arises when household preferences for consumption variety is sufficiently large and it can also lead to the multiplicity of monetary equilibria."

Technology shocks shift yields through their effect on expected inflation and the term premium. Shocks to preferences for current consumption affect yields through their impact on real rates and expected inflation. For both shocks, the systematic reaction of monetary policy is an important transmission pathway.

In particular, the average cross-country correlation of inflation is significantly and systematically stronger than that of output, while the cross-country correlation of money growth is essentially zero. We investigate whether standard monetary models driven by monetary shocks are consistent with the empirical facts. We find that neither the new Keynesian sticky-price model nor the sticky-information model can fully explain the data. An independent contribution of the paper is to provide a simple solution technique for solving general equilibrium models with sticky information."

We first show that versions of these models in which firms update non-re-optimized prices to lagged inflation account well for the statistical behavior of post-war U.S. inflation rates. We then investigate whether these models imply plausible degrees of inertia in price setting behavior by firms. They do, but only if we depart from two standard auxiliary assumptions: monopolistically competitive firms face a constant elasticity of demand, and capital is homogeneous and can be instantaneously reallocated after a shock. We develop a version of the model in which these assumptions are relaxed and show that it is consistent with the view that firms re-optimize prices, on average, once every two quarters."

This requires that the data-generating process consistent with the DSGE theoretical model has a finite order VAR representation. This paper discusses the assumptions needed for a finite order VAR(p) representation of a DSGE model to exist. When a VAR(p) is only an approximation to the exact infinite order VAR, the truncated VAR(p) may return largely incorrect estimates of the impulse response function. The results do not hinge on small-sample bias or on incorrect identification assumptions. But the bias introduced by truncation can lead to bias in the identification of the structural shocks. Identification strategies that work in the exact VAR representation perform poorly in the truncated VAR."

This paper presents an estimated model that departs from rational expectations and nests learning by economic agents, habits, and indexation. Bayesian methods facilitate the joint estimation of the learning gain coefficient together with the 'deep' parameters of the economy. The empirical results show that when learning replaces rational expectations, the estimated degrees of habits and indexation drop closer to zero, suggesting that persistence arises in the model economy mainly from expectations and learning."

This paper analyzes whether accounting for uncertainty across competing models and (or) real-time data considerations can explain this discrepancy. It considers a central bank that chooses a Taylor rule in a framework that allows for an aversion to the second-order risk associated with facing multiple models and measurement-error configurations. The paper finds that if the central bank cares strongly enough about stabilizing the output gap, this aversion leads to significant declines in the coefficients of the Taylor rule even if the central bank's loss function assigns little weight to reducing interest rate variability. Furthermore, a small degree of aversion can generate an optimal rule that matches the empirical Taylor rule."

We use this model to examine the cyclical behavior of aggregate fixed investment, variable capital investment, and output in the presence of persistent idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. Our model yields three main results. First, the effect of the irreversibility constraint on fixed capital investment is reinforced by the financing constraint. Second, the effect of the financing constraint on variable capital investment is reinforced by the irreversibility constraint. Finally, the interaction between the two constraints is key for explaining why input inventories and material deliveries of US manufacturing firms are so volatile and procyclical, and also why they are highly asymmetrical over the business cycle."

For market participants, estimated parameter values are intuitively appealing, but differ from existing estimates. They also differ from parameter values commonly used in computational experiments.

When there is higher turbulence, in the sense of worse skill transition probabilities for workers who suffer involuntary layoffs, high government mandated unemployment insurance (UI) and employment protection (EP) in Europe increase unemployment rates and durations. But when there is lower turbulence, high European EP suppresses unemployment rates despite high European UI. Four matching models differ in how they assign unemployed workers to matching functions. That affects how strongly unemployment responds to increases in turbulence. Heterogeneity among unemployed workers highlights the central role of adverse labor market externalities in matching models and reveals that the cost of posting vacancies is the lynchpin of a matching model."

Understanding European unemployment with matching and search-island models. Journal of Monetary Economics, this issue]. Because there is no frictional unemployment in the representative family model, an increase in employment protection (EP) decreases aggregate work because the representative family substitutes leisure for work, an effect opposite to what occurs in matching and search-island models. Heterogeneity among workers highlights the economy-wide coordination in labor supply and consumption sharing that employment lotteries and complete markets achieve in the representative family model. A high disutility of labor makes generous UI cause very low employment levels."

We use a well-known and simple smoothing method that is shown to fit the data very well. The resulting estimates can be used to compute yields or forward rates for any horizon.

This paper studies a general equilibrium life-cycle economy with capital in which households include both consumption and leisure in their period utility function. A calibrated version of the model shows that a significant hump in life-cycle consumption is a feature of the equilibrium. Thus inclusion of leisure in household preferences may provide part of the explanation of observed life-cycle consumption humps.

State-dependent pricing and the general equilibrium dynamics of money and output. Quarterly Journal of Economics 114, 655-690]. This state-dependent Phillips curve encompasses the new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) based on Calvo-type price setting as a special case. We analyze the effect of the state-dependent terms (that is, the variations in the distributions of price vintages) on inflation persistence, and we examine whether the hybrid NKPC (that is, the NKPC extended by a lagged inflation term) can adequately describe inflation dynamics generated in a calibrated state-dependent pricing economy."

We show that optimal nominal exchange rate volatility will reflect these competing objectives. The key determinants of how much the exchange rate should respond to shocks will depend on the extent and source of price stickiness, the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, and the amount of home bias in production. Quantitatively, we find the optimal exchange rate volatility should be significantly less than would be inferred based solely on terms of trade considerations. Moreover, we find that the relationship between price stickiness and optimal exchange rate volatility may be non-monotonic."

A dynamic, two-country model allows for debt finance, supply-side effects, and controls for wartime spending. The model can fit the historical paths of French net exports and the terms of trade. But explaining French output and consumption requires additional shocks. These results illustrate the usefulness of the DSGE approach to the transfer problem and provide striking evidence of the importance of international capital markets in the 19th century."

Multiple equilibria are possible: if foreign lenders are pessimistic about the country's stability, they demand a high interest on the debt, exacerbating distortions and possibly leading to political crisis, but if lenders are optimistic, the cost of the debt falls and political crises disappear. In such a case, international liquidity packages can select the best equilibrium and rule out political crises at negligible cost."

We estimate this framework using macroeconomic data for Germany (1975-1998) and for the U.S. (1983-2003). In each case, we find that the data are well-characterized by nominal contracts with an average duration of about two to three quarters. We also find that new contracts exhibit very low sensitivity to marginal cost, corresponding to a relatively high degree of real rigidity. Finally, our results indicate that backward-looking price-setting behavior (such as indexation to lagged inflation) is not needed in explaining the aggregate data, at least in an environment with a stable monetary policy regime and a transparent and credible inflation objective."

Recent literature finds that the estimated effects of technology shocks are sensitive to how one treats hours per capita. However, after allowing for (statistically and economically significant) trend breaks in productivity, results are much less sensitive: hours fall when technology improves. The issue is that the common high-low-high pattern of productivity growth and hours (i.e., the low-frequency correlation) inevitably leads to a positive estimated response. The trend breaks control for this correlation. This example suggests a practical need for care in using long-run restrictions."

Moreover, the initial overinvestment is accompanied by apparently inflated stock prices and apparently negative expected excess returns in the new industry, which are also fully rational. This suggests a new interpretation of what seems to be stock market driven real bubbles."

We therefore extend the standard New Keynesian model to allow for positive trend inflation, showing that even low trend inflation has strong effects on optimal monetary policy and the dynamics of inflation, output and interest rates. Under discretion, the efficient policy deteriorates and there is no guarantee of determinacy. Even with commitment, targeting non-zero trend inflation leads to substantial welfare losses.

We develop a formal relationship between the dynamics of house prices, structures costs and land prices, and thereby construct the first constant-quality price and quantity indexes for the aggregate stock of residential land in the United States. In a range of applications we show that these series can shed light on trends, fluctuations and regional variation in the price of housing."

This is due to an ex post wealth effect on labor supply (rich productive agents work fewer hours) that runs counter the precautionary savings motive. As a result, equilibrium savings and output may be lower under incomplete markets. It is also found that long-run savings remain finite even when the interest rate equals the inverse of the discount factor."

We argue that the timing of these investment cash outflows makes used capital attractive to financially constrained firms, since it is cheap when evaluated using their discount factor. In contrast, it may be expensive from the vantage point of an unconstrained agent. We provide an overlapping generations model and determine the price of used capital in equilibrium. Agents with less internal funds are more credit constrained, invest in used capital, and start smaller firms. Empirically, we find that the fraction of investment in used capital is substantially higher for small firms and varies significantly with measures of financial constraints."

However, to the extent that federal funds futures reflect risk premia, these measures require some adjustment. In this paper, we document that excess returns on federal funds futures have been positive on average and strongly countercyclical. In particular, excess returns are surprisingly well predicted by macroeconomic indicators such as employment growth and financial business-cycle indicators such as Treasury yield spreads and corporate bond spreads. Excess returns on eurodollar futures display similar patterns. We document that simply ignoring these risk premia significantly biases forecasts of the future path of monetary policy. We also show that risk premia matter for some futures-based measures of monetary policy shocks used in the literature."

45,"AB: For many kinds of capital, depreciation rates change systematically with the age of the capital. Consider an example that captures essential aspects of human capital, both regarding its accumulation and its depreciation: a worker obtains knowledge in period 0, then uses this knowledge in production in periods 1 and 2, and thereafter retires. Here, depreciation accelerates: it occurs at a 100% rate after period 2, and at a lower (perhaps zero) rate before that. The present paper analyzes the implications of non-constant depreciation rates for the optimal timing of taxes on capital income. The main finding is that under natural assumptions, the path of tax rates over time must be oscillatory. Oscillatory tax rates are optimal when depreciation rates accelerate with the age of the capital (as in the above example), and provided that the government can commit to the path of future tax rates but cannot apply different tax rates in a given year to different vintages of capital."

That is, we find asymmetric price adjustment ""in the small."" Furthermore, it turns out that inflation offers only a partial explanation for the finding. Indeed, substantial proportion of the asymmetry remains unexplained, even after accounting for the inflation. For example, the asymmetry holds also after excluding periods of inflation from the data, and even for products whose price had not increased. The findings hold for different aggregate and disaggregate measures of inflation and also after allowing for lagged price adjustments."

94,"AB: Early studies of business cycles argued that contractions in economic activity were briefer (shorter) and more violent (rapid) than expansions. This paper systematically investigates this claim and in the process discovers a robust new business cycle fact: contractions in employment are briefer and more violent than expansions but we cannot reject the null of equal brevity and violence for expansions and contractions in output. The difference arises because employment typically lags output around peaks but they coincide in their troughs. We discuss the performance of existing business cycle models in accounting for this fact, and conclude that none can fully account for it. We then show that a business cycle model with asymmetric adjustment costs on employment and a choice of when to scrap old technologies can account for the business cycle fact both qualitatively and quantitatively."

First, how does policy towards debt default affect the evolution of consumption and net worth over the life-cycle? Second, how does debt default policy interact with social insurance over the life-cycle? The findings are as follows. First, US default policy appears ""lax"", in the sense that it creates severe credit constraints, especially for the young. Second, eliminating default will lower consumption inequality among the young, but will increase it among the old. Third, social insurance alters default risk and, in turn, loan pricing, and therefore matters for purely intertemporal smoothing."

A key assumption in the model is a relatively low elasticity of substitution between home and foreign inputs in the production of the vertically integrated good.

This paper offers a new approach to disentangle the relationship between changes in equity values and monetary policy. Specifically, the paper distinguishes the FOMC's reaction to forecasts of traditional goal variables, which may depend on equity prices, from the FOMC's independent reaction to changes in equity prices. By using actual forward-looking variables examined by the FOMC before each action (the ""Greenbook"" forecasts), the authors find little evidence to support the proposition that the FOMC responds to stock values, except as filtered through a forecast of accepted monetary policy goal variables."

Nonborrowed reserves decreased with inflation in the post-1979 period and increased in the pre-1979 period.

249,"AB: Higher wages all else equal translate into higher inflation. More rigid wages imply a weaker response of inflation to shocks. This view of the wage channel is deeply entrenched in central banks' views and models of their economies. In this paper, we present a model with equilibrium unemployment which has three distinctive properties. First, using a search and matching model with right-to-manage wage bargaining a proper wage channel obtains. Second, accounting for fixed costs associated with maintaining an existing job greatly magnifies profit fluctuations for any given degree of wage fluctuations, which allows the model to reproduce the fluctuations of unemployment over the business cycle. And third, the model implies a reasonable elasticity of steady state unemployment with respect to changes in benefits. The calibration of the model implies low profits, but does not require a small gap between the value of working and the value of unemployment for the worker."

284,"AB: The New Keynesian Phillips curve explains inflation dynamics as being driven by current and expected future real marginal costs. In competitive labor markets, the labor share can serve as a proxy for the latter. In this paper, we study the role of real marginal cost components implied by search frictions in the labor market. We construct a measure of real marginal costs by using newly available labor market data on worker finding rates. Over the business cycle, the measure is highly correlated with the labor share. Estimates of the Phillips curve using generalized method of moments reveal that the marginal cost measure remains significant, and that inflation dynamics are mainly driven by the forward-looking component. Bayesian estimation of the full New Keynesian model with search frictions helps us disentangle which shocks are driving the economy to generate the observed unit labor cost dynamics. We find that mark-up shocks are the dominant force in labor market fluctuations."

320,"AB: We find that demand shocks play an important role for business-cycle fluctuations in unemployment and job vacancies. The reason is that those shocks give a strong incentive to demand-constrained firms to adjust production and thereby labor input. Furthermore we argue that whether real wage rigidity a la Hall [2005. Employment fluctuations with equilibrium wage stickiness. American Economic Review 95, 50-65] helps explain the remaining part of the unemployment volatility puzzle depends critically on assumptions regarding the form of the wage bargain between firms and workers. Real wage rigidity tends to generate volatility in employment only in the case in which hours are chosen efficiently. If, on the other hand, the real wage is allowed to affect firms' choices of hours directly, the feature of real wage rigidity loses its ability to increase employment volatility."

338,"AB: The goal of this paper is to examine the interaction of sticky prices and labor market frictions. Sveen and Weinke argue that introducing sticky prices, monetary policy shocks, and preference shocks into a fairly standard matching model helps to address the unemployment volatility puzzle, that a flexible price model is unable explain the empirical volatility of the vacancy-unemployment ratio relative to the volatility of labor productivity. Whereas the model with only a productivity shock generates about five percent of the fluctuations in the vacancy-unemployment ratio, their baseline model produces half the observed volatility in this key labor market variable. Since I am not a monetary economist, I find it useful to step back and think about a purely real version of the model, inspired by Blanchard and Gali (2006). This model provides a plausible baseline in which fluctuations in productivity have no effect on labor market outcomes. The model differs in some details from Sveen and Weinke's, and so I also explain why productivity shocks do affect unemployment in their model and consider whether these are really the most economically relevant departures from the baseline. I then examine how nominal rigidities affect this conclusion and use that to assess Sveen and Weinke's quantitative conclusions. Finally, I close with some thoughts on this and other New Keynesian models of price setting."

This paper analyzes optimal monetary policy in this kind of hybrid framework. I show that zero inflation is optimal when all wages are Nash bargained in every period and the economy's steady state is efficient. In the more realistic case in which nominal wage bargaining is staggered, a case against price stability arises: in response to real shocks, the central bank should use price inflation so as to avoid excessive unemployment volatility and excessive dispersion in hiring rates. For a plausible calibration, the welfare loss under the zero inflation policy is about three times as large as under the optimal policy."

374,"AB: The synthesis between new Keynesian models and the non-Walrasian theory of unemployment moves a step forward in replicating business cycle facts concerning the labor market and provides a useful benchmark for policy analyses. One consequence of this is that researchers also question how and whether prescriptions of optimal monetary policy can change into this new environment. This is exactly the question that motivates Carlos Thomas paper. This paper builds a new Keynesian model with matching frictions and staggered Nash bargained wages (obtained by introducing a Calvo, 1983, structure for nominal wage stickiness into an otherwise standard Nash bargaining process) and uses this model economy to analyze the design of optimal monetary policy. The latter is implemented through a micro-founded linear quadratic approach a la Woodford (2003) which consists in deriving a quadratic loss function by taking second order approximation of agents' utility. This loss function, in combination with the linearized constraints describing the economy's competitive equilibrium, is used to implement the design of optimal monetary policy. Thomas' paper confirms the optimality of price stability in the presence of matching frictions and flexible wages, while deviations from zero inflation are optimal in presence of wage rigidity. Deviations from zero inflation occur since real wage rigidity distorts incentives for efficient job creation and since wage dispersion induces inefficient dispersion in hiring rates. Those two distortions are summarized in the gap between the allocation arising under efficient Nash bargaining and the allocation associated with wage rigidity. The paper also stresses how the introduction of wage rigidity into the matching framework helps to reconcile the Barro (1977) critique which states that for ongoing employment relations we would expect employers and employees to neutralize the distortionary effects of wage stickiness. The combination of matching frictions and Nash staggered wages allows to do so as private efficiency of employment relationships is preserved."

410,"AB: Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, and Sahin (KMRS) bring together a true labor-supply margin and a frictional labor market. For a long time, macro has been split into two camps with respect to fluctuations in the labor market, one descended from the real business cycle model that portrays all movements or differences in total hours of work as the result of choices about labor supply, while the other, identified with Mortensen-Pissarides and followers, portrays movements or differences as the result of changes in unemployment. Each of these are two-activity models. In the first, the alternative to work is the enjoyment of leisure, while in the second it is job search. The natural next step is a three-activity model, as in this paper. This paper tackles the fiscal questions that have interested Prescott, Rogerson, and others, mainly in the context of the widening gap between hours of work in the U.S. and Europe. Though differences in unemployment are not an important explanation of the gap, the paper reaches some interesting conclusions about the interplay between labor-market frictions and unemployment. One way to explore some of the modeling choices that face the researcher integrating labor supply and frictions is to compare two attempts. Naturally I choose my own work to make the comparison. Table 1 compares the assumptions KMRS made about the parameters of preferences to those that I derived from studying the recent microhousehold research on these parameters. I use lower intertemporal substitution (Frisch elasticity of consumption demand) as found by Attanasio and Weber (1995) and others, while the authors use 1 for the traditional reason that it accords with zero trend in hours given an upward trend in real wages. I use a labor-supply elasticity derived from Pistaferri (2003), while the authors do not consider the elasticity explicitly, but use a restricted functional form that implies a high Frisch elasticity. They assume separability of consumption and hours while I use an elasticity implying complementarity between them."

It builds on recent work by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (CEE, 2005) and Smets and Wouters (SW, 2003), who developed medium-scale estimable dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that are able to capture U.S. and Euro-Area business cycles. An estimated version of the SW model was used by Levin et al. (2006) to study optimal monetary policy in the presence of parameter uncertainty."

Aggregate and panel data from the restructured (after 1997 crisis) banking industry of South Korea for the period 2002-2006 are used. Our results indicate that high level of diversification across interest and non-interest activities, as well as, across broad type of loans (i.e., corporate, household and other loans) is negatively significantly correlated with insolvency risk and positively significantly correlated with risk-adjusted returns, providing evidence for the market-discipline hypothesis. Concerning bank loan portfolio risks, less diversified across industries, loan portfolios are correlated with higher non-performing loan ratio. A shift from manufacture lending towards real estate and lease business lending can reduce the risk of bank loan portfolio. Therefore, bank regulations that focus on stable profitability and bank soundness should provide incentives for diversification."

In fact, it is reinforced. Even without nominal price rigidities, price stability is optimal because it enhances the risk sharing properties of nominal bonds."

597,"AB: Does an inflation conservative central bank a la Rogoff (1985) remain desirable in a setting with endogenous fiscal policy? To provide an answer we study monetary and fiscal policy games without commitment in a dynamic, stochastic sticky-price economy with monopolistic distortions. Monetary policy determines nominal interest rates and fiscal policy provides public goods generating private utility. We find that lack of fiscal commitment gives rise to excessive public spending. The optimal inflation rate internalizing this distortion is positive, but lack of monetary commitment generates too much inflation. A conservative monetary authority thus remains desirable. When fiscal policy is determined before monetary policy each period, the monetary authority should focus exclusively on stabilizing inflation. Monetary conservatism then eliminates the steady state biases associated with lack of monetary and fiscal commitment and leads to stabilization policy that is close to optimal."

That the central bank uses the information in the term structure to set policy creates a link between the bond market and the macroeconomy that is novel to the literature. The estimated model suggests that there is some information in US yields of maturities of less than 1 year that can help the Federal Reserve to identify shocks to the economy on a timely basis."

631,"AB: Costly nominal wage adjustment has received renewed attention in the design of optimal policy. In this paper, we embed costly nominal wage adjustment into the modern theory of frictional labor markets to study optimal fiscal and monetary policy. The main result is that the optimal rate of price inflation is quite volatile despite the presence of nominal wage rigidities. This finding contrasts with results obtained in standard sticky-wage models, which employ neoclassical labor markets at their core. In addition, the tax-smoothing result that lies at the heart of optimal policy prescriptions in standard Ramsey models does not carry over to a search and bargaining environment. Both results stem from a common source in our model. Shared rents associated with the formation of long-term employment relationships imply that the optimal policy entails fluctuations in after-tax real wages much larger than in models with neoclassical labor markets, in which no such rent-sharing margin exists. The results demonstrate that the level at which nominal wage rigidity is modeled--whether simply layered on top of a neoclassical market or articulated in the context of an explicit relationship between workers and firms--can matter a great deal for policy recommendations."

Furthermore, under quadratic loss, commercial forecasts seem to have information not contained in those forecasts. To investigate the cause of this apparent irrationality, this paper recovers the loss function implied by Federal Reserve's inflation forecasts. The results suggest that the cost of having inflation above an implicit time-varying target was larger than the cost of having inflation below it for the period since Volcker, and that the opposite was true for the pre-Volcker era. Once these asymmetries are taken into account, the Federal Reserve's inflation forecasts are found to be rational."

The generosity of bankruptcy protection is found to change both the incentives and the ability of households to accumulate durable wealth. The gains from a high level of insurance are reduced by the effect of tighter credit constraints, so that the net effects of a change in exemption are very small. A more generous bankruptcy regulation reduces net durable wealth in the first half of the life cycle. In addition, the optimal level of exemption is positive but low."

A government imposes a legal restriction that prohibits bonds from being used to buy a subset of goods. I show that this legal restriction can increase the society's welfare. In contrast to the literature, this efficiency role persists in the steady state and even when the households cannot trade assets after receiving the shocks. Moreover, it can exist when the Friedman rule is available and when the restriction is only obeyed by government agents."

Emerging economies show a stronger response and hence converge to lower mean debt-output ratios, as observed in the data.

This paper presents a simple dynamic general equilibrium model to articulate this view, and calibrates the model to the U.S. World War II experience. Analysis of the calibrated model indicates that the welfare value of conscription as a fiscal policy tool is quantitatively large: despite the fact that the American involvement lasted only four years, conscription is worth approximately 2% of annual aggregate consumption in perpetuity."

In the model, price discrimination causes ERPT to be incomplete in both the short and the long run. In the short run, a small amount of nominal rigidities is enough to reduce ERPT sharply, still, exchange-rate depreciation worsens the terms of trade, consistent with the evidence. Possible biases from omitted variables and measurement error in the ERPT empirical literature (due to data limitations) are investigated using model-generated time series. Estimates of ERPT coefficients can be quite different from true parameters, and are sensitive to the shocks driving the economies. Estimates can nonetheless detect key structural features of the models."

Critics, however, have argued that these models need to be modified to account for observed money growth and inflation trends, and that monetary trends may serve as a useful cross-check for monetary policy. We identify an important source of monetary trends in form of persistent central bank misperceptions regarding potential output. Simulations with historical output gap estimates indicate that such misperceptions may induce persistent errors in monetary policy and sustained trends in money growth and inflation. If interest-rate prescriptions derived from Keynesian-style models are augmented with a cross-check against money-based estimates of trend inflation, inflation control is improved substantially."

Each economy has a monetary policymaker that attempts to control the economy through the use of a linear nominal interest rate feedback rule. The main results show how the determinacy of worldwide equilibrium depends on the joint behavior of policymakers worldwide. The results also show how indeterminacy exposes all economies to endogenous volatility, even ones where monetary policy may be judged appropriate from a closed economy perspective. Two quantitative cases are discussed. In the 1970s, worldwide equilibrium was characterized by a two-dimensional indeterminacy, despite US adherence to a version of the Taylor principle. In the last 15 years, worldwide equilibrium was still characterized by a one-dimensional indeterminacy, leaving all economies exposed to endogenous volatility. This analysis provides a rationale for a type of international policy coordination, and the gains to coordination in the sense of avoiding indeterminacy may be large."

Microeconomic dissonance means that the underlying microeconomic differences between ostensibly equivalent models become important when optimal monetary policy is derived. The relevance of these concepts is established by analysis of optimal monetary policy using a small-scale New Keynesian model. Microeconomic and financial datasets are promising tools with which to overcome the equivalence/dissonance problem.

970,"AB: The optimal control approach to monetary policy has garnered increased attention in recent years. Optimal control policies, however, are designed for the specific features of a particular model and therefore may not be robust to model misspecification. One important source of potential misspecification is how agents form expectations. Specifically, whether they know the complete structure of the model as assumed in rational expectations or learn using a forecasting model that they update based on incoming data. Simulations of an estimated model of the U.S. economy show that the optimal control policy derived under the assumption of rational expectations can perform poorly when agents learn. The optimal control approach can be made more robust to learning by deemphasizing the stabilization of real economic activity and interest rates relative to inflation in the central bank loss function. That is, robustness to learning provides an incentive to employ a ""conservative"" central banker. In contrast to optimal control policies, two types of simple monetary policy rules from the literature that have been found to be robust to model misspecification in other contexts are shown to be robust to learning."

988,"AB: A monopsony model with a symmetric equilibrium is developed where posting higher wages reduces employee departures. This monopsony implies that wage changes have small effects on profits so that employer altruism affects wages as well. Even selfish firms act altruistically if workers punish firms that fail to do so. If the marginal utility of income falls sharply with income, the model can explain modest responses of wages to shifts in labor demand. If there are fluctuations in the altruism required by workers, the low correlation of wages and employment and the sizes of the cyclical fluctuations in these two series can be rationalized."

We show that the term premium on long-term bonds in the canonical dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model used in macroeconomics is far too small and stable relative to the data. We find that introducing long-memory habits in consumption as well as labor market frictions can help fit the term premium, but only by seriously distorting the DSGE model's ability to fit other macroeconomic variables, such as the real wage, therefore, the bond premium puzzle remains."

We establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions.

1051,AB: This paper conducts a comparative evaluation of the predictive performance of various Value-at-Risk (VaR) models. Special emphasis is paid to two methodologies related to the Extreme Value Theory (EVT): The Peaks Over Threshold (POT) and the Block Maxima (BM). We apply both unconditional and conditional EVT models to management of extreme market risks in stock markets. They are applied on daily returns of the BVMT and CAC 40 indices with the intention to compare the performance of various estimation methods on markets with different capitalisation and trading practices. The results we report demonstrate that conditional POT EVT method produces the most accurate forecasts of extreme losses both for standard and more extreme VaR quantiles. The conditional block maxima EVT method is less accurate.

Yet, VaR is not a coherent risk measure because it is not sub-additive. This paper applies the methodology of risk budgeting to determine if VaR qualifies as a coherent risk measure. We show that the tools of risk budgeting allow VaR to be treated as a coherent risk measure, even though it does not restore sub-additivity. The main finding is that the additional analysis provided by risk budgeting means that VaR is a useful tool even if it is not sub-additive."

A more reliable measure of risk is the probability distribution of the return on an asset. Estimators for these measures are usually challenging and need of nonparametric and semi-parametric techniques. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes the use of semi-parametric estimators of the distribution function of the return on an asset based on extreme value theory for computing Value-at-Risk, and second, it discusses the validity of different volatility models in this semi-parametric framework. The conclusion is that different volatility models can yield different valid risk measures if coupled with the appropriate distribution function. Hence the puzzle in the choice of volatility measures. This is shown in an empirical exercise for data of financial indexes from USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Spain."

We follow Friedman and Schwartz [1963. A Monetary History of the United States, 1857-1960. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ] in hypothesizing that the Great Depression heightened fears of economic instability. We use a robustness calculation to elicit a pessimistic prior for a representative consumer and let him update beliefs via Bayes' law. Learning eventually erases pessimism, but while it persists, pessimism contributes a volatile multiplicative component to the stochastic discount factor that a rational-expectation econometrician would detect. With sufficient initial pessimism, the model generates substantial values for the market price of risk and equity premium and predicts high Sharpe ratios and forecastable excess stock returns."

The analysis reveals an important trade-off for these welfare calculations. On the one hand, higher wage uncertainty increases the cost associated with missing insurance markets. On the other hand, greater wage dispersion presents opportunities to raise aggregate productivity by concentrating market work among more productive workers. Welfare effects can be expressed in terms of the underlying parameters defining preferences and wage risk or, alternatively, in terms of changes in observable second moments of the joint distribution over individual wages, consumption and hours."

1266,"AB: This paper studies the incentives of participants in a real-time gross settlement system with and without the addition of a liquidity-saving mechanism (LSM). Participants in the model face a liquidity shock and different costs for delaying payments. They trade off the cost of delaying a payment against the cost of borrowing liquidity from the central bank. The main contribution of the paper is to show that the design of an LSM has important implications for welfare. In particular, parameters determine whether the addition of an LSM increases or decreases welfare."

1282,"AB: We investigate whether capital market imperfections constrain investment during an emerging market financial crisis. Both large currency devaluations and banking sector failures characterize recent crises. Although a currency devaluation should increase exporters' competitiveness and investment, a failing banking system may limit credit to these firms. Foreign-owned firms, which may have greater access to overseas financing but otherwise face the same investment prospects, provide an ideal control group for determining the effect of liquidity constraints. We test for liquidity constraints in Indonesia following the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, a period when the issuance of new domestic credit shrank rapidly. Exporters' value added and employment increased after the crisis, suggesting that they profited from the devaluation and had sufficient cash flow to finance more workers. However, only exporters with foreign ownership increased their capital significantly. Our results suggest that liquidity constraints greatly retarded domestic-owned manufacturing firms' ability to take advantage of improved terms of trade. Specifically, compared to foreign-owned exporters they had resembled before the crisis, after the crisis domestic-owned exporters had more than 20% lower employment and capital and more than 40% lower value added and materials usage."

1300,"AB: The first generation models of currency crises have often been criticized because they predict that, in the absence of very large triggering shocks, currency attacks should be predictable and lead to small devaluations. This paper shows that these features of first generation models are not robust to the inclusion of private information. In particular, this paper analyzes a generalization of the Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG) model, which relaxes the assumption that all consumers are perfectly informed about the level of fundamentals. In this environment, the KFG equilibrium of zero devaluation is only one of many possible equilibria. In all the other equilibria, the lack of perfect information delays the attack on the currency past the point at which the shadow exchange rate equals the peg, giving rise to unpredictable and discrete devaluations."

1316,"AB: If countries specialize in imperfectly substitutable goods, trade costs increase the share of expenditure devoted to domestic output, reducing the exposure of consumer price inflation to exchange rate changes. I present a multi-country flexible-price model where expenditure shares are inversely related to trade costs through a gravity equation. In this setting, consumer price inflation can be approximated as an expenditure-share-weighted average of the contributions to inflation from all countries. I use data from 24 OECD countries, 1970-2003, to estimate a structural gravity model. I combine the fitted expenditure shares from the estimation with actual data on exchange rates to construct predictions of inflation. The behavior of these predictions indicates that trade costs can explain both qualitatively and quantitatively the failure of exchange rate volatility to feed into inflation."

The median level of persistence (across goods) is low, and there is no evidence of a border effect: the half-life of a deviation is about 19 months across OECD cities and just 1 month lower across cities in the U.S. Aggregating our micro-data using a variety of weighting methods shows PPP persistence to be in the range of 1-2 years, over the 1990-2005 period. These results challenge three widely held views: (i) the classical dichotomy is irrelevant, (ii) high persistence is a robust feature of aggregate real exchange rates, and (iii) border crossings necessarily generate greater real exchange rate persistence."

Our recursive preferences are homogeneous and satisfy a balanced-growth condition, while allowing us to separate the role of risk aversion and intertemporal elasticity of substitution. We perform some quantitative exercises that disentangle the respective roles played by these two parameters in optimal distortions and the implied welfare gains."

However, effective tax rates constructed from official tax rates show little relation to capital--or to revenue-based tax measures.

1558,"AB: We provide a simple framework for comparing market allocations with government-regulated allocations. Governments can collect information about individuals' types and enforce transfers across individuals. Markets (without significant government intervention) have to rely on transactions that are ex post beneficial for individuals. Consequently, governments achieve better risk sharing and consumption smoothing than markets. However, politicians in charge of collective decisions can use the centralized information and the enforcement power of government for their own benefits. This leads to political economy distortions and rents for politicians, making government-operated allocation mechanisms potentially worse than markets. We provide conditions under which it is ex ante beneficial for the society to tolerate the political economy distortions in exchange for the improvement in risk sharing. For example, more effective controls on politicians or higher discount factors of politicians make governments more attractive relative to markets. Moreover, when markets cannot engage in self-enforcing risk-sharing arrangements and income effects are limited, greater risk aversion and greater uncertainty make governments more attractive relative to markets. Nevertheless, we also show theoretically and numerically that the effect of risk aversion on the desirability of markets may be non-monotonic. In particular, when markets can support self-enforcing risk-sharing arrangements, a high degree of risk aversion improves the extent of risk sharing in markets and makes governments less necessary. The same pattern may also arise because of ""income effects"" on labor supply. Consequently, the welfare gains of governments relative to markets may have an inverse U-shape as a function of the degree of risk aversion of individuals."

Embedding a probabilistic-voting setup of electoral competition in the standard OLG model with capital accumulation, we find that intergenerational transfers arise in the absence of altruism, commitment, or trigger strategies. Closed-form solutions predict population ageing to lead to higher social security tax rates, a rising share of pensions in GDP, but eventually lower social security benefits per retiree. The response of equilibrium tax rates to demographic shocks reduces old-age consumption risk. Calibrated to match features of the U.S. economy, the model suggests that, in response to the projected demographic transition, social security tax rates will gradually increase to 16%. Other policies that distort labor supply will become less important, labor supply therefore will rise, in contrast with frequently voiced fears."

Using a two-sector general-equilibrium model, we show that differences in economy-wide productivity, barriers to modern intermediate inputs in agriculture, and barriers in the labor market generate large cross-country differences in the share of employment and labor productivity in agriculture. The model implies a factor difference of 10.8 in aggregate labor productivity between the richest and the poorest 5% of the countries in the world, leaving the unexplained factor at 3.2. Overall, this two-sector framework performs much better than a single-sector growth model in explaining observed differences in international productivity."

The critical assumption is that financial markets are characterized by limited enforcement of contracts, and in the event of default only a fraction of borrowers' assets can be seized. Limited enforcement reduces the fraction of assets that can be used as collateral and thus individuals subject to liquidity shocks face borrowing constraints. We show how banks endogenously overcome these borrowing constraints by pooling resources across several depositors, and increase the liquidity provided by financial markets."

I present a simple framework, which embeds the role of liquidity creating banks in an otherwise standard general equilibrium growth model. A capital requirement limits the moral hazard on the part of banks that arises due to deposit insurance. However, this capital requirement is also costly because it reduces the ability of banks to create liquidity. The key insight is that equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of households' preferences for liquidity and this allows for the derivation of a simple formula for the welfare cost of capital requirements that is a function of observable variables only. Using US data, the welfare cost of current capital adequacy regulation is found to be equivalent to a permanent loss in consumption of between 0.1% and 1%."

Both debt constraints and incomplete asset markets are needed to account for inequality, but asset market incompleteness is the key friction. It better accounts for the concentration and dispersion of wealth, and is the most costly friction in terms of welfare. Tight debt constraints are important for explaining the lower tail of the wealth distribution."

The inertial behaviour of inflation is driven by privately informed firms strategically 'herding' on the public information contained in the observations of lagged aggregate variables. The model also matches the average duration between price changes found in the data and it nests the standard New-Keynesian Phillips Curve as a special case.

In this paper, we investigate the validity of such an interpretation. We present a computational dynamic general equilibrium model capable of generating aggregate behavior similar to the data along several dimensions. By construction, model agents form ""rational"" expectations. We run a standard regression on equilibrium realizations of inflation and inflation expectations over sample periods corresponding to those tests performed on actual data and find evidence of an apparent bias in inflation expectations. Our experiments suggest that this incorrect inference is largely the product of a small sample problem, exacerbated by short-run learning dynamics in response to infrequent shifts in monetary policy regimes."

The empirical analysis concentrates on the construction companies listed in Athens Exchange, for the period 1995-2006, which coincides with significant construction activity in Greece. It is investigated whether Z-score models can predict bankruptcies for a period up to eight years earlier. It is derived that a particular Altman model performs well in predicting failures for a period up to five years earlier. This is in line with other findings. The empirical results are interesting as they can be used by portfolio managers in stock selection and by company management for merger decisions or other corporate strategic moves."

Variations in the number of operating firms lead to countercyclical variations in markups that give rise to endogenous procyclical movements in measured total factor productivity (TFP). Based on this result, the paper suggests a simple structural decomposition of variations in TFP into those originating from exogenous shocks and those originating endogenously from the interaction between firms' entry and exit decisions and the degree of competition. The decomposition suggests that around 40% of the movements in measured TFP can be attributed to this interaction. Moreover, the paper analyzes the effects on (i) the measurement of the volatility of exogenous shocks in the U.S. economy and (ii) the magnification of shocks over the business cycle."

We utilize an empirical micro-founded euro-area DSGE model, a quadratic approximation of household utility as the welfare criterion, employing a nominal interest rate lower bound. In contrast to previous studies, we find significant commitment stabilization gains of around a 0.4-0.5% equivalent permanent consumption increase, and with higher price stickiness gains over 2%. We find that a simple optimized commitment rule responding to inflation and the real wage mimics the optimal one."

This paper presents evidence on a phenomenon of disintermediation occurring during the major recessions in the 1960s and 1970s, but absent ever since, and shows that disintermediation is closely linked to the existence of deposit rate ceilings under regulation Q. In a monetary DSGE model that incorporates deposit rate ceilings as occasionally binding constraints, the regulation alters the behavior of money aggregates and exacerbates the drop in economic activity following a monetary tightening. The results of a threshold VAR lend support to the main theoretical predictions of the model."

Goods are sequentially introduced starting out as a luxury with high income elasticity and ending up as a necessity with low income elasticity. Although this leads to rising and falling sectoral employment shares, the model exhibits a steady growth path along which the Kaldor facts are satisfied. Extending the basic model to the case of endogenous product innovations shows that complementarities between aggregate and sectoral growth may give rise to multiple equilibria."

2099,"AB: How does risk affect saving? Empirical work typically examines the effects of detectible differences in risk within the data. How these differences affect saving in theoretical models depends on the metric one uses for risk. For labor-income risk, second-degree increases in risk require prudence to induce increased saving demand. However, prudence is not necessary for first-degree risk increases and not sufficient for higher-degree risk increases. For increases in interest-rate risk, a precautionary effect and a substitution effect need to be compared. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions on preferences for an Nth-degree change in risk to increase saving."

This paper uses a calibrated general equilibrium model of lending from the wealthy to the middle class to evaluate the welfare effects of this reform quantitatively. We find that the ""indirect"" effects of endogenous interest rate and other relative price changes dominate the ""direct"" effect of relaxing the constraint. The borrowing household's welfare falls even though the reform directly relaxes a constraint on its trade. The saving household's welfare rises substantially."

43,"AB: Was the increase in income inequality in the US due to permanent shocks or merely to an increase in the variance of transitory shocks? The implications for consumption and welfare depend crucially on the answer to this question. We use Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) repeated cross-section data on consumption and income to decompose idiosyncratic changes in income into predictable life-cycle changes, transitory and permanent shocks and estimate the contribution of each to total inequality. Our model fits the joint evolution of consumption and income inequality well and delivers two main results. First, we find that permanent changes in income explain all of the increase in inequality in the 1980s and 1990s. Second, we reconcile this finding with the fact that consumption inequality did not increase much over this period. Our results support the view that many permanent changes in income are predictable for consumers, even if they look unpredictable to the econometrician, consistent with models of heterogeneous income profiles."

78,"AB: This paper uses a dynamic political economy model to evaluate whether the observed rise in wage inequality and decrease in median to mean wages can explain some portion of the relative increase in transfers to low earnings quintiles and relative increase in effective tax rates for high earnings quintiles in the U.S. over the past several decades. Specifically, we assume that households have uninsurable idiosyncratic labor efficiency shocks and consider policy choices by a median voter which are required to be consistent with a sequential equilibrium. We choose the transition matrix to match observed mobility in wages between 1978 and 1979 in the panel study of income dynamics (PSID) data set and then evaluate the response of social insurance policies to a new transition matrix that matches the observed mobility in wages between 1995 and 1996 and is consistent with the rise in wage inequality and the decrease in median to mean wages between 1979 and 1996. We deal with the problem that policy outcomes affect the evolution of the wealth distribution (and hence prices) by approximating the distribution by a small set of moments. We contrast these numbers with those from a sequential utilitarian mechanism, as well as mechanisms with commitment."

113,"AB: Economists with a few exceptions have automatically assumed that the important measure of well-being is income. In contrast, economic historians have broadened the measure of well-being with particular interest in mortality, morbidity, nutrition, education and leisure. When one takes this broader view of the standard of living, there appears to be a strong trend toward more equality in the distribution of well-being since the industrial revolution. Gini coefficients calculated for the distributions of lifespan and educational attainment have declined dramatically since the mid-nineteenth century for the United States. Mortality and educational differentials have also declined. Inequality of leisure time and consumption, though not as consistently measured, also show trends toward equality over the twentieth century. These trends toward equality in well-being as measured by indicators other than income and wealth seem to be generated by provision of public goods, natural boundaries to lifespan, educational attainment and leisure, and by the growth in mean per capita income. The divergent trends in the distributions of income and the other measures of well-being caution against reliance on the distribution of income to interpret trends in inequality."

Similar to other structured finance products, investors in CLOs rely heavily on credit rating provided by the rating agencies, yet little is known about CLO rating practices. This paper attempts to fill the gap. Using novel hand-collected data on 3912 tranches of collateralized loan obligations we document the rating practices of CLOs and analyze their structures."

When there is a lack of opportunities for banks to hedge idiosyncratic and aggregate liquidity shocks, the interbank market is characterized by excessive price volatility. In such a situation, a central bank can implement the constrained efficient allocation by using open market operations to fix the short term interest rate. It can be constrained efficient for banks to hoard liquidity and stop trading with each other if there is sufficient uncertainty about aggregate liquidity demand compared to idiosyncratic liquidity demand."

284,"AB: Credit rating agencies (CRAs) are accused of bearing a strong responsibility for contributing to the subprime crisis by having been deliberately too lax in the ratings of some structured products. In response to this accusation, CRAs argue that such an attitude would be too dangerous for them, since their reputation is at stake. The objective of this article is to examine the validity of this argument within a formal model: Are reputation concerns sufficient to discipline rating agencies? We show that the reputation argument only works when a sufficiency large fraction of the CRA income comes from other sources than rating complex products. By contrast when rating complex products becomes a major source of income for the CRA, we show that it is always too lax with a positive probability and inflates ratings with probability one when its reputation is good enough. We provide some empirical support for this prediction, by showing that ceteris paribus, the proportion of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) that were rated AAA by the three main CRAs indeed increased over the last eight years. We analyze the policy implications of our findings and advocate for a new business model of CRAs that we call the platform-pays model."

314,"AB: Many identify inflated credit ratings as one contributor to the recent financial-market turmoil. We develop an equilibrium model of the market for ratings and use it to examine possible origins of and cures for ratings inflation. In the model, asset issuers can shop for ratings--observe multiple ratings and disclose only the most favorable--before auctioning their assets. When assets are simple, agencies' ratings are similar and the incentive to ratings shop is low. When assets are sufficiently complex, ratings differ enough that an incentive to shop emerges. Thus, an increase in the complexity of recently issued securities could create a systematic bias in disclosed ratings, despite the fact that each ratings agency produces an unbiased estimate of the asset's true quality. Increasing competition among agencies would only worsen this problem. Switching to an investor-initiated ratings system alleviates the bias, but could collapse the market for information."

344,"AB: We examine the consequences of existing regulations on the quality of mortgage loans originations in the originate-to-distribute (OTD) market. The information asymmetries in the OTD market can lead to moral hazard problems on the part of lenders. We find, using a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the ease of securitization, that the quality of loan origination varies inversely with the amount of regulation: more regulated lenders originate loans of worse quality. We interpret this result as a possible evidence that the fragility of lightly regulated originators' capital structure can mitigate moral hazard. In addition, we find that incentives which require mortgage brokers to have 'skin in the game' and stronger risk management departments inside the bank partially alleviate the moral hazard problem in this setting. Finally, having more lenders inside a mortgage pool is associated with higher quality loans, suggesting that sharper relative performance evaluation made possible by more competition among contributing lenders can also mitigate the moral hazard problem to some extent. Overall, our evidence suggests that market forces rather than regulation may have been more effective in mitigating moral hazard in the OTD market. The findings caution against policies that impose stricter lender regulations which fail to align lenders' incentives with the investors of mortgage-backed securities."

We show that the borrowers whose loans are sold in the secondary market underperform their peers by about 9% per year (risk-adjusted) over the three-year period following the initial sale of their loans. Therefore, either banks are originating and selling loans of lower quality borrowers based on unobservable private information (adverse selection), and/or loan sales lead to diminished bank monitoring that affects borrowers negatively (moral hazard). We propose regulatory restrictions on loan sales, increased disclosure, and a loan trading exchange/clearinghouse as mechanisms to alleviate these problems."

414,"AB: We present an endogenous growth model that explains the evolution of the first and second moments of productivity growth at the aggregate and firm level during the post-war period. Growth is driven by the development of both (i) idiosyncratic R&D innovations and (ii) general innovations that can be freely adopted by many firms. Firm-level volatility is affected primarily by the Schumpeterian dynamics associated with the development of R&D innovations. The variance of aggregate productivity growth is driven by the arrival rate of general innovations. Ceteris paribus, the share of resources spent on development of general innovations increases with the stability of the market share of the industry leader. As market shares become less persistent, the model predicts an endogenous shift in the allocation of resources from the development of general innovations to the development of R&D innovations. This results in an increase in R&D, an increase in firm-level volatility, and a decline in aggregate volatility. The effect on productivity growth is ambiguous. On the empirical side, this paper presents new cross-country evidence that R&D subsidies are not significantly associated with higher growth but are associated with lower aggregate volatility. It also documents an upward trend in the instability of market shares, a positive association between firm volatility and R&D spending, and a negative association across sectors between R&D and how correlated the sector is with the rest of the economy."

Existing studies find support for this hypothesis because they fail to control for the presence of omitted variables. Controlling for these factors either by including country fixed effects in a linear model or by including parameterized random effects in a nonlinear double hazard model removes the correlation between income and the likelihood of transitions to and from democratic regimes. In addition, the estimated fixed effects from the linear model are related to historical factors that affect both the level of income per capita and the likelihood of democracy in a country. This evidence is consistent with the idea that events during critical historical junctures can lead to divergent political-economic development paths, some leading to prosperity and democracy, others to relative poverty and non-democracy."

467,"AB: How do firing costs affect aggregate productivity growth? To address this question, a model of endogenous growth through selection and imitation is developed. It is consistent with recent evidence on firm dynamics and on the importance of reallocation for productivity growth. In the model, growth is driven by selection among heterogeneous incumbent firms and is sustained as entrants imitate the best incumbents. In this framework, firing costs not only induce misallocation of labor, but also affect growth by affecting firms' exit decisions. Importantly, charging firing costs only to continuing firms raises growth by promoting selection. Also charging them to exiting firms is akin to an exit tax, hampers selection, and reduces growth--by 0.1 percentage points in a calibrated version of the model. With job turnover very similar in the two settings, this implies that the treatment of exiting firms matters for growth. In addition, the impact on growth rates is larger in sectors where firms face larger idiosyncratic shocks, as in services. This fits evidence that recent EU-U.S. growth rate differences are largest in these sectors and implies that firing costs can play a role here."

In contrast to macroeconomic convention, this paper argues that the share of nontraded goods is endogenous, a time-varying product of macroeconomic shocks and trade costs that are heterogeneous across goods. A simple open economy model demonstrates that trade cost heterogeneity and a time-varying margin of tradedness dramatically reduces the volatility of nontraded prices. This also reduces the ability of real exchange rate adjustments to dampen current account imbalances."

Consequently, the usual logic does not rule out solutions with explosive inflation. That result does not, however, justify negative conclusions about NK analysis, for a different criterion is logically satisfactory. It is that, to be plausible, a RE solution must satisfy the property of least-squares learnability. Adoption of this criterion serves to justify in principle the bulk of current mainstream analysis."

565,"AB: Most countries have tax provisions and subsidies to promote homeownership. These provisions generate an asymmetry in the tax treatment of owner- and rental-occupied housing, which affects the incentives to supply tenant-occupied housing. This paper analyzes the quantitative importance of the interaction of these provisions with the progressivity of income taxation in the context of an overlapping generations model with housing and rental markets. The model replicates the key facts observed in the economy, as well as distributional patterns of ownership, house size, and landlord behavior. The model suggests that the progressivity of income taxation can amplify or mitigate the effects of the asymmetries with important implications for housing tenure, housing consumption, portfolio reallocations, and welfare that differ from those reported in the literature."

664,"AB: This study intends to determine the impact of monetary policy changes on Islamic banks vis-a-vis conventional banks. In achieving this, the study explores the dynamic inter-relationships between deposits and loans of the Islamic and conventional banks with monetary policy variable using two major tests. First, the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used to examine the long-run relationship among the variables. Second, the vector error-correction model (VECM) is adopted to explore the short- and long-run dynamics between the variables. The study focuses on Malaysian data covering the period from January 1998 to December 2006. The study finds that the Islamic banks' balance sheet items are relatively more sensitive to monetary policy changes, compared to the conventional banks balance sheet items. This implies that the impact of monetary policy is more de-stabilising on the Islamic banks than on the conventional banks."

We estimate several specifications to study the impact of bank-specific and country-specific variables, including macro-economic conditions, market structure and institutional development, on bank profitability. The results provide evidence suggesting that capitalisation and management efficiency enhance bank profitability. The results also indicate that bank profitability is positively associated with, economic growth, inflation, and bank concentration. We also show that Islamic bank profitability is higher in countries with better socio-economic conditions and better legal systems."

874,"AB: Discretionary conduct of monetary stabilization policy can increase real and nominal aggregate volatility by arbitrary amounts when firms pay limited attention to aggregate shocks. A conservative central banker with stronger preference for price stability eliminates the commitment problem, thereby reduces output and price volatility and gives rise to a policy-induced 'Great Moderation'. Increased focus on price stability facilitates firms' information processing and aligns their expectations better with policy decisions. This 'coordination effect' reduces aggregate real and nominal volatility. Consistent with empirical evidence, the moderation manifests itself through reduced residual variance in vector autoregressions (VARs) involving macroeconomic variables."

889,"AB: The question that motivates this paper is how incomplete information impacts the response of prices to nominal shocks. Our baseline model is a variant of the Calvo model in which firms observe the underlying nominal shocks with noise. In this model, the response of prices is pinned down by three parameters: the precision of available information about the nominal shock, the frequency of price adjustment, and the degree of strategic complementarity in pricing decisions. This result synthesizes the broader lessons of the pertinent literature. However, this synthesis provides only a partial view of the role of incomplete information. Once one allows for more general information structures than those used in previous work, one cannot quantify the degree of price inertia without data on the dynamics of higher-order beliefs, or of the agents' forecasts of inflation. We highlight this with three extensions of our baseline model, all of which break the tight connection between the precision of information and higher-order beliefs featured in previous work."

This paper assesses its importance by estimating the new Keynesian (NK) model under alternative informational assumptions. One version focuses on confusion between temporary and persistent disturbances. Another, on unobserved variation in the inflation target of the Central Bank. A third on persistent mis-perceptions of the state of the economy (measurement error). And a fourth assumes perfect information (the standard NK-DSGE version). Imperfect information is found to contain considerable explanatory power for business fluctuations. Signal extraction seems to provide a conceptually satisfactory, empirically plausible and quantitatively important business cycle mechanism."

Firms update their expectations about fundamentals based on their own cash flows (revenues and wages). We show that in a model with realistic levels of product-level price dispersion, the firms' inference about aggregate shocks is very gradual, yet in the aggregate prices adjust rapidly in response to aggregate nominal shocks. When an aggregate shock occurs, firms mistakenly attribute it to firm-specific shocks, but adjust prices nevertheless, since the exact nature of the shock matters little for their optimal pricing decision."

We argue that these features are artifacts created by the neglect of a change in the slope of the trend function. Once this is accounted for, all methods yield the same cycle with a trend that is non-stochastic except for a few periods around 1973. The cycle is more important in magnitude than previously reported and it accords well with the NBER chronology. Our results are corroborated using an alternative trend-cycle decomposition based on a generalized unobserved components models with errors having a mixture of normals distribution for both the slope of the trend function and the cyclical component."

We quantify the direct effect on real consumption of unanticipated changes in discretionary income, shifts in precautionary savings, and changes in the operating cost of energy-using durables. The possibility of asymmetries in the response of real consumption to energy price shocks is also considered. We demonstrate that linear models are consistent with the symmetric behavior of real consumption in 1979 (when energy prices increased sharply) and in 1986 (when they fell sharply). It is shown that historically energy price shocks have been an important factor in explaining U.S. real consumption growth, but by no means the dominant factor."

However, this paper shows that if consumers are impatient and are subject to transitory as well as permanent shocks, the optimal marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks (the MPCP) is strictly less than one, because buffer-stock savers have a target wealth-to-permanent-income ratio, a positive shock to permanent income moves the ratio below its target, temporarily boosting saving."

In recessions, idiosyncratic labor productivity shocks raise income dispersion, lower the price elasticity of demand, and increase imperfectly competitive firms' optimal markups. The calibrated model explains not only many cyclical features of markups, but also cyclical and long-run patterns of standard business cycle aggregates."

For CRRA preferences, stylized real-world policies (notably safe debt and safe pensions) are found inefficient in the direction of imposing not enough productivity risk on retirees and too much on future generations. Safe transfers can be rationalized as efficient if preferences display age-increasing risk aversion, such as habit formation. The ubiquity of safe transfers suggests that governments treat the young as more risk tolerant than older cohorts."

Both estimated policy rate responses and FOMC transcripts are consistent with intermediate targeting of monetary aggregates throughout the Great Inflation of the 1970s. The unpublished FOMC targets for M1 growth are tabulated. Empirical results support an effective inflation target of roughly 7% in the 1970s and 3% thereafter. A notable difference in the 1970s monetary policies of the US and Germany is the absence of explicit public objectives for US long-run inflation.

1098,"AB: The conduct of monetary policy, the term structure of interest rates and the structure of the economy in the UK have changed over the post-WWII period. We model the interaction between the macroeconomy and financial markets using a time-varying VAR augmented with the factors from the yield curve. There is evidence of a great moderation in the dynamics of the yield curve, with the factors being persistent and volatile before the introduction of inflation targeting in 1992 but becoming stable afterwards. The introduction of time-variation in the factor augmented VAR improves the fit of the model and results in expectation hypothesis consistent yields that are close to actual yields, even at long maturities. Monetary policy shocks had a significant impact on the volatility of inflation, output and the policy rate over the pre-inflation targeting era, but their contribution has been negligible under the current regime. Shocks to the level of the yield curve accounted for a large fraction of inflation variability only before 1992."

The two factors predict 77.9-82.1% of the daily variation in LIBOR and swap rates from one month to 10 years. Shocks on inflation-related releases have large, positive impacts on interest rates of all maturities, leading to parallel shifts of the yield curve, but shocks on output-related releases have larger impacts on the short rate than on the long rate, thus generating a slope effect."

This paper investigates this topic by simulating the effects of reductions in firing costs and unemployment benefits on inflation volatility in the Euro Area, using an estimated New Keynesian model with search and matching frictions. Qualitatively, changes in labor market policies alter the volatility of inflation in response to shocks, by affecting the volatility of the three components of real marginal costs (hiring costs, firing costs, and wage costs). Quantitatively, we find, however, that neither policy is likely to have an important effect on inflation volatility, due to the small contribution of hiring and firing costs to inflation dynamics."

1167,AB: A formula is derived that links the coefficients of the monetary policy rule for the short-term interest rate to the coefficients of the implied affine equations for long-term interest rates. The formula predicts that an increase in the coefficients in the monetary policy rule will lead to an increase in the coefficients in the affine equations. Empirical evidence for such a prediction is provided. The curve of the response coefficients by maturity is also predicted by the formula. The formula's predictive accuracy and its closed form make it a useful tool for studying the policy implications of embedding no-arbitrage affine theories into macro models.

Unlike existing literature, unemployed individuals can secretly participate in a hidden labor market. This extension modifies the standard problem in three dimensions. First, it imposes an endogenous lower bound for the lifetime utility that a contract can deliver. Second, it breaks the identity between unemployment payments and consumption. And third, it hardens the encouragement of search effort. The optimal unemployment insurance system in an economy with a hidden labor market is simple, with an initial phase in which payments are relatively flat during unemployment and with no payments for long-term unemployed individuals. This scheme differs substantially from the one prescribed without a hidden labor market and resembles unemployment protection programs in many countries."

If money is the only asset, then inflation mostly hurts the wealthier and more productive agents, while those poorer and less productive may even benefit from inflation. The converse holds in a more sophisticated financial environment where agents can insure against consumption risk with assets other than money."

This paper proposes a new interpretation of this apparent puzzle based on the demand for insurance against real shocks: the fact that devaluations occur more frequently in adverse states of the world provides a motive for holding dollar assets. This approach implies a complementarity between the optimal monetary policy and the currency denomination of contracts. When a large proportion of liabilities is denominated in a foreign currency, the optimal exchange rate volatility is low, which reinforces the demand for dollar assets."

In fact, our paper examines Tunisia as a case study to empirically prove the relation between inflation rate and unemployment rate. Our findings provide evidence about the existence of a long run trade-off between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate in Tunisia."

This leads to a lower risk-free rate and, under certain conditions, also to a lower capital-labor ratio and lower productivity."

This paper demonstrates that, even when wages are allocative, downward wage rigidity can be consistent with weak macroeconomic effects. Firms have an incentive to compress wage increases as well as wage cuts when downward wage rigidity binds. By neglecting compression of wage increases, previous literature may have overstated the costs of downward wage rigidity to firms. Using micro-data from the US and Great Britain, I find that the evidence for the compression of wage increases when downward wage rigidity binds. Accounting for this reduces the estimated increase in aggregate wage growth due to wage rigidity to be much closer to zero. These results suggest that downward wage rigidity may not provide a strong argument against the targeting of low inflation rates."

Equilibrium contracts feature wage smoothing, limited by the inability of parties to commit to contracts. The model is consistent with aggregate wage data if neither worker nor firm can commit, producing too rigid wages otherwise.

A model is developed to capture both the cleansing and the scarring effects. A key ingredient of the model is that idiosyncratic productivity is not directly observable, but can be learned over time. When calibrated with statistics on entry, exit and productivity differentials, the model suggests that the scarring effect dominates the cleansing effect, and gives rise to lower average productivity during recessions."

Moreover, the subsidy takes the form of deductions from the progressive income tax system giving high income earners a larger subsidy. To understand the effect of the policy, we construct a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogenous agents and an endogenous demand for health insurance. A complete removal of the subsidy may lead to a partial collapse of the group insurance market, reduce the insurance coverage and deteriorate welfare. There is, however, room for improving the coverage and welfare by extending a refundable credit to the individual insurance market."

Estimating a dynamic factor model for 404 inflation sub-indices of the euro area CPI allows to decompose the dynamics of inflation sub-indices into a part due to a common macroeconomic shock and to sector specific idiosyncratic shocks. Although idiosyncratic shocks dominate the variance of sectoral prices, one common factor appears to be the main driver of aggregate dynamics. In addition, the heterogenous propagation of this common shock across sectoral inflation rates, and in particular its slow propagation to inflation rates of services, generates the persistence of aggregate inflation. We conclude that the aggregation mechanism explains a significant amount of aggregate inflation persistence."

Theoretical papers do not provide a definite answer regarding the dominance of one type of auction over the other. We investigate the revealed preferences of the issuers by surveying the sovereign issuers that conduct auctions. We find that the majority of the issuers/countries in our sample use a discriminatory auction mechanism for issuing government debt. We use a multinomial logit procedure and discriminatory analysis to investigate the mechanism choice. It was interesting to find that market-oriented economies and those that practice common law tend to use a uniform method while economies who are less market oriented and practice civil law tend to use discriminatory price auctions."

We find great interdependence between the interest rate setting and real stock prices. Real stock prices immediately fall by seven to nine percent due to a monetary policy shock that raises the federal funds rate by 100 basis points. A stock price shock increasing real stock prices by one percent leads to an increase in the interest rate of close to 4 basis points."

When monitoring costs associated with intermediation are sufficiently low, the two activities can be separated from one another.

As two leading examples, secondary currencies were widespread during both the Great Depression in the United States and the 2002 recession in Argentina. What are the determinants of multiple currency usage and what is the effect on economic activity? Both issues are empirically addressed using individual-level surveys collected by the authors in Argentina during 2002 and 2003. The evidence supports the theoretically predicted determinants of secondary currency acceptability put forth in monetary theory. In particular, findings show that the acceptability of the secondary currency increases when the supply of national currency is low, the relative transaction cost of the secondary currency is low, and the individual trading technologies are less effective. Moreover, the acceptability of the secondary currency has real effects on economic activity. Among those who use the secondary currency the monthly income gain is more than 15% of the average Argentine's monthly income. Excluding trades of used goods, this amounts to a 0.6% increase in GDP."

The reason is that the matching friction induces entrepreneurs to increase investment in new projects and vacancies early. If there is underinvestment in new projects in the competitive equilibrium, then the efficiency gains associated with an increase in employment make it possible that consumption, employment, output, as well as the investment in new and existing projects jointly increase long before the actual increase in productivity materializes. If there is no underinvestment, then investment in existing projects decreases, but total investment, consumption, employment, and output still jointly increase."

In particular, the employment response to a permanent productivity shock is more likely to be positive the less costly it is to hold inventories, the more elastic industry demand is, and the more flexible prices are. Using data on 458 4-digit U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1958-1996, we find statistically significant effects of variations in inventory holdings and demand elasticities on short-run employment responses, but less conclusive evidence pertaining to the effects of measured price stickiness."

1819,"AB: What are the steady-state implications of inflation in a general-equilibrium model with real per capita output growth and staggered nominal price and wage contracts? Surprisingly, a benchmark calibration implies an optimal inflation rate of -1.9 percent. The analysis also shows that trend inflation has important effects on the economy when combined with nominal contracts and real output growth. Steady-state output and welfare losses are quantitatively important even for low values of trend inflation. Further, nominal wage contracting is found to be quantitatively more important than nominal price contracting in generating the results. This conclusion does not arise from price dispersion per se, but from an effect of nominal output growth on the optimal markup of monopolistically competitive labour suppliers. Finally, accounting for productivity growth is found to be important for calculating the welfare costs of inflation. Indeed, the presence of 2 percent productivity growth increases the welfare costs of inflation in the benchmark specification by a factor of four relative to the no-growth case."

This paper evaluates the empirical validity of this prediction by studying the effects of shocks to monetary aggregates using a vector autoregression (VAR). Shocks to monetary aggregates are identified by the restrictions suggested by New Keynesian monetary models. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, shocks to broad monetary aggregates have substantial and persistent effects on output, prices, and interest rates."

Although links between technological change, output and productivity are found, results suggest that the slowdown in technological progress in the early 1930s did not contribute significantly to the Great Depression.

1951,"AB: To identify disruptions in credit markets, research on the role of asset prices in economic fluctuations has focused on the information content of various corporate credit spreads. We re-examine this evidence using a broad array of credit spreads constructed directly from the secondary bond prices on outstanding senior unsecured debt issued by a large panel of nonfinancial firms. An advantage of our ""ground-up"" approach is that we are able to construct matched portfolios of equity returns, which allows us to examine the information content of bond spreads that is orthogonal to the information contained in stock prices of the same set of firms, as well as in macroeconomic variables measuring economic activity, inflation, interest rates, and other financial indicators. Our portfolio-based bond spreads contain substantial predictive power for economic activity and outperform--especially at longer horizons--standard default-risk indicators. Much of the predictive power of bond spreads for economic activity is embedded in securities issued by intermediate-risk rather than high-risk firms. According to impulse responses from a structural factor-augmented vector autoregression, unexpected increases in bond spreads cause large and persistent contractions in economic activity. Indeed, shocks emanating from the corporate bond market account for more than 30 percent of the forecast error variance in economic activity at the two- to four-year horizon. Overall, our results imply that credit market shocks have contributed significantly to US economic fluctuations during the 1990-2008 period."

The results appear robust to time window, alternative measures of financial development and exchange rate volatility, and outliers.

Working paper, University of Pennsylvania]. Moreover, the individual-specific growth component may be stochastic. Motivated by these empirical observations, I study an individual's optimal consumption-saving and portfolio choice problem when he does not observe his income growth. As in standard income fluctuation problems, the individual cannot fully insure himself against income shocks. In addition to the standard income-risk-induced precautionary saving demand, the individual also has learning-induced precautionary saving demand, which is greater when belief is more uncertain. With constant unobserved income growth, changes in belief are not predictable. However, with stationary stochastic income growth, belief is no longer a martingale. Mean reversion of belief reduces hedging demand on average and in turn mitigates the impact of estimation risk on consumption-saving and portfolio decisions."

This paper estimates the reactions using high-frequency data on nominal and index-linked bond yields, allowing the effects of news announcements on real rates and inflation compensation to be parsed far more precisely than is possible using daily data. Long-term nominal yields and forward rates are very sensitive to macroeconomic news announcements. Inflation compensation is sensitive to announcements about price indices and monetary policy. However, for news announcements about real economic activity, such as nonfarm payrolls, the vast majority of the sensitivity is concentrated in real rates. Accordingly, most of the sizeable impact of news about real economic activity on the nominal term structure of interest rates represents changes in expected future real short-term interest rates and/or real risk premia rather than changes in expected future inflation and/or inflation risk premia. Such sensitivity of real rates to macroeconomics news is hard to rationalize within the framework of existing macroeconomic models."

We estimate a medium-scale macro-finance DSGE model of the term structure to establish this. Our finding contrasts with existing macro-finance models and suggests that their--small-scale or non-structural--perspective on the macroeconomy mutes expectations, thereby underestimating the expectations hypothesis' potential. Out-of-sample forecasts are competitive with more flexible term structure models. Given the empirical validation, we interpret various episodes through the lens of the model and investigate which structural shocks cause the yield curve to contain information about future growth."

This paper uses changes in technology to identify the same set of parameters. Estimates based on technology shocks differ substantially from those based on monetary policy shocks. In the post-World War II United States, a positive technology shock reduces inflation and increases hours worked, significantly and rapidly in both cases. Relative to policy shock identification, technology shock identification implies: (i) long duration durability in preferences instead of short duration habit, (ii) built-in inflation inertia disappears and price flexibility increases. In response to technological improvement, consumption durability increases hours worked because households temporarily increase labor supply to accumulate durables towards a new, higher steady state level. Limited nominal rigidities allow inflation to fall because firms are able to immediately cut prices when households' labor supply increases. Finally, we consider alternative data constructions and econometric specifications, we find that (i) and/or (ii) hold in nearly every case."

23,"AB: The IMF's Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model is used to compute short-run multipliers of fiscal stimulus measures and long-run crowding-out effects of higher debt. Multipliers of two-year stimulus range from 0.2 to 2.2 depending on the fiscal instrument, the extent of monetary accommodation and the presence of a financial accelerator mechanism. A permanent 10 percentage point increase in the US debt to GDP ratio raises the US tax burden and world real interest rates in the long run, thereby reducing US and rest of the world output by 0.3-0.6 percent and 0.2-0.3 percent, respectively."

57,"AB: We estimate the effects of fiscal policy on the labor market in US data. An increase in government spending of 1 percent of GDP generates output and unemployment multipliers, respectively, of about 1.2 percent (at one year) and 0.6 percentage points (at the peak). Each percentage point increase in GDP produces an increase in employment of about 1.3 million jobs. Total hours, employment, and the job finding probability all rise, whereas the separation rate falls. A standard neoclassical model augmented with search and matching frictions in the labor market largely fails in reproducing the size of the output multiplier whereas it can produce a realistic unemployment multiplier but only under a special parameterization. Extending the model to strengthen the complementarity in preferences, to include unemployment benefits, real wage rigidity and/or debt financing with distortionary taxation only worsens the picture. New Keynesian features only marginally magnify the size of the multipliers. When complementarity is coupled with price stickiness, however, the magnification effect can be large."

I use the model to explain the current financial crisis as a shift to a high unemployment equilibrium, induced by the self-fulfilling beliefs of market participants about asset prices. I ask two questions. (1) Can fiscal policy help us out of the crisis? (2) Is there an alternative to fiscal policy that is less costly and more effective? The answer to both questions is yes."

127,"AB: The paper studies a fiscal policy instrument that can reduce fiscal distortions without affecting revenues, in a politically viable way. The instrument is a private contract (tax buyout), offered by the government to each citizen, whereby the citizen can choose to pay a fixed price in exchange for a given reduction in her tax rate for a period of time. We introduce the tax buyout in a dynamic overlapping generations economy, calibrated to match several features of the US income, taxes, and wealth distribution. Under simple pricing, the introduction of the buyout is revenue neutral but, by reducing distortions, benefits a significant fraction of the population and leads to sizable increases in aggregate labor supply, income, and consumption."

162,"AB: A rational expectations framework is developed to study the consequences of alternative means to resolve the ""unfunded liabilities"" problem--unsustainable exponential growth in federal Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending with no plan to finance it. Resolution requires specifying a probability distribution for how and when monetary and fiscal policies will change as the economy evolves through the 21st century. Beliefs based on that distribution determine the existence of and the nature of equilibrium. We consider policies that in expectation combine reaching a fiscal limit, some distorting taxation, modest inflation, and some reneging on the government's promised transfers. In the equilibrium, inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot successfully anchor expected inflation. Expectational effects are always present, but need not have a large impacts on inflation and interest rates in the short and medium runs."

This paper contributes to this debate by studying the driving forces of fluctuations in an estimated new neoclassical synthesis model of the U.S. economy. In this model, most of the variability of output and hours at business cycle frequencies is due to shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment. Imperfect competition and, to a lesser extent, technological frictions are the key to their transmission. Although labor supply shocks explain a large fraction of the fluctuations in hours at very low frequencies, they are irrelevant over the business cycle. This finding is important because the microfoundations of these disturbances are widely regarded as unappealing."

The marginal rate of transformation implies a novel macro-factor asset pricing model that does a reasonable job explaining the cross-sectional variation in average stock returns with plausible parameter values. Using a flexible representation of firms' production technology, producers' ability to transform output across states of nature is estimated to be high, in contrast with what is typically assumed in standard aggregate representations of firms' production technology."

349,"AB: Information is ""market-consistent"" if agents only use market prices to infer the underlying states of the economy. This paper applies this concept to a stochastic growth model with incomplete markets and heterogeneous agents. The economy with market-consistent information can never replicate the full information equilibrium, and there are substantial differences in impulse responses to aggregate productivity shocks. These results are robust to the introduction of a noisy public signal and aggregate financial markets. We argue that the principle of market-consistent information should be applied to any model with incomplete markets."

We suggest that these facts can be explained as a consequence of the restrictive trade regime adopted at that time. Our framework is based on a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model, with scale economies in the capital-intensive sector. Initially, the economy is open and produces only the labor-intensive good. The trade regime is modeled as a move to a closed economy. The model produces results consistent with the Latin American experience. Specifically, a sufficiently small country experiences no long-run income growth, but an increase in capital."

Lack of identification means that the empirical implications of some model parameters are either undetectable or indistinguishable from the implications of other parameters. Therefore, identifiability must be verified prior to estimation. This paper provides a simple method for conducting local identification analysis in linearized DSGE models, estimated in both full and limited information settings. In addition to establishing which parameters are locally identified and which are not, researchers can determine whether the identification failures are due to data limitations, such as lack of observations for some variables, or whether they are intrinsic to the structure of the model. The methodology is illustrated using a medium-scale DSGE model."

Moreover, both price inflation and wage inflation evolve as indicated by equations equivalent to those obtained in Erceg et al. (2000), though with different slope coefficients. In an equal-volatility comparison, the model with unemployment conveys less price stickiness and more wage stickiness."

This paper addresses this question within a model where firms engage in two types of investment: a short-term one, and a long-term one, which contributes more to productivity growth. Because it takes longer to complete, long-term investment has a relatively less cyclical return, but it also has a higher liquidity risk. The first effect ensures that the share of long-term investment to total investment is countercyclical when financial markets are perfect, the second implies that this share may turn procyclical when firms face tight credit constraints. A novel propagation mechanism thus emerges: through its effect on the cyclical composition of investment, tighter credit can lead to both higher volatility and lower mean growth. Evidence from a panel of countries provides support for the model's key predictions."

482,"AB: The monetary policy literature assumes increasingly that policy is formulated according to the timeless perspective (Woodford, 1999a). However, by treating appropriately the auxiliary state variables that characterize the timeless perspective equilibrium when evaluating policy performance, this paper shows that discretionary policymaking can be superior to timeless perspective policymaking and identifies model features that make this outcome more likely. Using standard New Keynesian DSGE models, discretion is found to dominate timeless perspective policymaking when the price/wage Phillips curves are relatively flat, due, perhaps, to firm-specific capital (or labor) and/or Kimball (1995) aggregation in combination with nominal rigidities. These results suggest that studies applying the timeless perspective might also usefully compare its performance to discretion, paying careful attention to how policy performance is evaluated."

In US data there is indeed a strikingly high time series correlation between the yield on nominal bonds and the dividend yield on equities. This positive correlation is often attributed to the fact that both bond and equity yields comove strongly and positively with expected inflation. Contrary to some of the extant literature, we show that this effect is consistent with modern asset pricing theory incorporating uncertainty about real growth prospects and habit-based risk aversion. In the US, high expected inflation has tended to coincide with periods of heightened uncertainty about real economic growth and unusually high risk aversion, both of which rationally raise equity yields."

To illustrate this effect, we develop an open economy DGE model featuring demand curves with variable elasticities so that a firm's pricing decision depends on its competitors' prices. As a result, a foreign exporter finds it optimal to vary its markup in response to shocks that change the exchange rate, insulating import prices from exchange rate movements. With increased trade integration, exporters have become more responsive to the prices of their competitors, explaining a sizeable portion of the observed decline in the sensitivity of U.S import prices to the exchange rate."

However, even mild departures of the data generating process from these assumptions can severely bias the estimates of the model parameters. This paper proposes new estimators that do not require researchers to take a stand on whether shocks have permanent or transitory effects. These procedures have two key features. First, the same filter is applied to both the data and the model variables. Second, the filtered variables are stationary when evaluated at the true parameter vector. The estimators are approximately normally distributed not only when the shocks are mildly persistent, but also when they have near or exact unit roots. Simulations show that these robust estimators perform well especially when the shocks are highly persistent yet stationary. In such cases, linear detrending and first differencing are shown to yield biased or imprecise estimates."

601,"AB: The welfare effects of intergenerational risk sharing through a pay-as-you-go social security system that is efficiently indexed to wages or interest rates are quantified. Comparing steady states, there are large welfare gains of being born into an economy with efficient risk sharing as compared to the current U.S. system. Efficient policy involves an increasingly risky net of tax income over the life cycle. When adjustment to steady state is taken into account, the welfare gains largely turn negative. The results are also compared and contrasted to the first best allocation."

Bank profitability tends to be higher in countries in which supervisors can take legal action against external auditors for negligence, in which the central bank is responsive for supervision. On the contrary, bank profitability is negatively related to the unification of financial supervision and the existence of Deposit Insurance (DI). Also, several bank characteristics and macroeconomic factors are significantly related to bank profitability."

The SSM seems to underreact to positive news for the first five days and then reactions tend to strengthen in the following weeks, indicating the presence of a Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD). At the same time, the SSM overreacts to negative news in the first five days and then reverses its direction and reports an upward PEAD. The individually dominated market combined with the absence of analysts' forecasts is the main explanation for this underreaction to positive news and overreaction to negative news."

If the cost of indexing is less than the cost of active investing, then all investors would index, which would result with no mechanism to price the possible investments. This paradox relies merely on understanding averages. It does not rely on markets being ""informationally efficient"", as demonstrated in a model where different investors have differing degrees of informational advantages and disadvantages."

Exploiting within-year variation in the timing of wage-setting decisions in these economies, we find support for the long-held but scarcely tested view that wage rigidity plays a critical role in the transmission of monetary policy."

However, this approach recommends huge fluctuations in positions, enormous changes in portfolios for minor changes in maturities and no presumption it is always optimal to issue long and invest short term in a wide array of model specifications. These extreme, volatile and unstable features are undesirable for two reasons. Firstly fragility of portfolios to small changes in assumptions means that it is often better to follow a balanced budget rather than issue the optimal debt portfolio under some possibly misspecified model. Secondly for even miniscule transaction costs, governments prefer a balanced budget rather than the large positions complete markets recommends. The complete market recommendations conflict with a number of features we believe are integral to bond market incompleteness, e.g. transaction costs, liquidity effects, robustness, etc. and which need to be explicitly incorporated into the portfolio problem."

The estimation reveals that rent-sharing (between workers and firms) and wage entitlement (based on past wages) are important determinants of wage setting for the model to fit the dynamic responses of output, wages and inflation to various exogenous shocks. Aggregate employment conditions (measuring workers' outside option), on the other hand, are found to play only a negligible role for wage setting. These results are consistent with micro-studies on reciprocity in labor relations but contrast with traditional efficiency wage models which emphasize aggregate labor market variables as the determinants of wage setting."

Indeterminacy is due to a vacancy channel of monetary policy that makes inflation expectations self-fulfilling. The effect of this channel strengthens as the sluggishness of the adjustment of employment relative to that of consumption increases. When this relative sluggishness is high, the Taylor principle fails to ensure determinacy, regardless of whether the policy is forecast-based or outcome-based, whether it is strictly or flexibly inflation targeting, or contains policy rate smoothing."

Diseases cause premature death, labor productivity loss and lower quality of life. Higher disease prevalence lowers the average saving-investment propensity. The model offers two insights. First, infectious disease can plausibly generate an unconventional growth trap where income alone cannot push an economy out of underdevelopment. Second, even when countries converge to the same balanced growth path, the disease ecology significantly impairs the pace of economic development."

Its many recommendations derive from two basic principles: that reformers need to think systemically, and that third-party costs stemming from systemic risk need to be internalized. And its approach is just what you would expect from a group of academic economists. It asks (and answers) questions like: Where did incentives go wrong? What were the sources of market failure? How can we better protect society against negative externalities?"

881,"AB: The Squam Lake Report (SLR) contains a host of recommendations to ""fix the financial sector."" A credible fix must take on the excessive risk-taking of financial institutions created when uninsured creditors of important financial institutions expect government protection from loss (i.e., the too-big-to-fail problem). The vast majority of SLR's recommendations constitute important contributions to addressing TBTF, the analysis offered in support of recommendations is sound and brings modern economics and finance to bear. The clarity and focus of SLR offers a model for academics writing for a policy audience. We differ in emphasis with SLR on a few issues, including capital and living wills, but support moving forward with the core of SLR's recommendations even in these cases. Legislation (i.e., ""Dodd-Frank"") seeking to fix the financial sector became law around the time SLR was published. The legislation includes in one form or another the predominance of credible recommendations made to address TBTF, including the majority of those in SLR. The ultimate success of the legislation, however, depends on implementation. We hope the government focuses on a macroprudential regime that reduces fallout from financial spillovers, considers new efforts to measure and tax expected TBTF subsidies, and reconsiders aspects of Dodd-Frank that expand the safety net. Given the stakes, another SLR-caliber effort, this time centered on Dodd-Frank implementation, promises high returns."

897,"AB: The relatively infrequent nature of major credit distress events makes an historical approach particularly useful. Using a combination of historical narrative and econometric techniques, we identify major periods of credit distress from 1875 to 2007, examine the extent to which credit distress arises as part of the transmission of monetary policy, and document the subsequent effect on output. Using turning points defined by the Harding-Pagan algorithm, we identify and compare the timing, duration, amplitude and co-movement of cycles in money, credit and output. Regressions show that financial distress events exacerbate business cycle downturns both in the 19th and 20th centuries and that a confluence of such events makes recessions even worse."

931,"AB: Two observations suggest that financial globalization played an important role in the recent financial crisis. First, more than half of the rise in net borrowing of the U.S. non-financial sectors since the mid-1980s has been financed by foreign lending. Second, the collapse of the U.S. housing and mortgage-backed-securities markets had worldwide effects on financial institutions and asset markets. Using an open-economy model where financial intermediaries play a central role, we show that financial integration leads to a sharp rise in net credit in the most financially developed country and to large asset price spillovers of country-specific shocks to bank capital. The impacts of these shocks on asset prices are amplified by bank capital requirements based on mark-to-market."

We show this in a general equilibrium model with regionally segmented bank-based retail financial markets, in which money markets facilitate the reallocation of funds across banks from different regions. Counterparty risk creates an asymmetry between banks in savings-rich regions, which remain marginally financed by the abundant regional insured deposits, and in savings-poor regions, which have to pay large spreads in money markets. This asymmetry distorts the aggregate allocation of credit and, in the presence of demand externalities, can cause large output losses."

997,"AB: Fundamental economic principles provide a rationale for requiring financial institutions to use mark-to-market, or fair value, accounting for financial reporting. The recent turmoil in financial markets, however, has raised questions about whether fair value accounting is exacerbating the problems. In this paper, we review the history and practice of fair value accounting, and summarize the literature on the channels through which it can adversely affect the real economy. We propose a new model to study the interaction of accounting rules with regulatory capital requirements, and show that even when market prices always reflect fundamental values, the interaction of fair value accounting rules and a simple capital requirement can create inefficiencies that are absent when capital is measured by adjusted book value. These distortions can be avoided, however, by redefining capital requirements to be procyclical rather than by abandoning fair value accounting and the other benefits that it provides."

1028,"AB: This paper provides a model of the view that the 2008 financial crisis is reminiscent of a bank run, focussing on six stylized key features. In particular, core financial institutions have invested their funds in asset-backed securities rather than committed to long-term projects: in distress, these can potentially be sold to a large pool of outside investors at steep discounts. I consider two different motives for outside investors and their interaction with banks trading asset-backed securities: uncertainty aversion versus adverse selection. I shall argue that the version with uncertainty averse investors is more consistent with the stylized facts than the adverse selection perspective: in the former, the crisis deepens, the larger the market share of distressed core banks, while a run becomes less likely instead as a result in the adverse selection version. Therefore, the outright purchase of troubled assets by the government at prices above current market prices may both alleviate the financial crises as well as provide tax payers with returns above those for safe securities."

1124,"AB: Model uncertainty has the potential to change importantly how monetary policy is conducted, making it an issue that central banks cannot ignore. Using a standard new Keynesian business cycle model, this paper analyzes the behavior of a central bank that conducts policy under discretion while fearing that its model is misspecified. The main results are as follows. First, policy performance can be improved if the discretionary central bank implements a robust policy. This important result is obtained because the central bank's desire for robustness directs it to assertively stabilize inflation, thereby mitigating the stabilization bias associated with discretionary policymaking. Second, the central bank's fear of model misspecification leads it to forecast future outcomes under the belief that inflation (in particular) will be persistent and have large unconditional variance, raising the probability of extreme outcomes. Private agents, however, anticipating the policy response, make decisions under the belief that inflation will be more closely stabilized, that is, more tightly distributed, than under rational expectations. Finally, as a technical contribution, the paper shows how to solve with robustness an important class of linear-quadratic decision problems."

1140,"AB: How does uncertainty about fundamentals affect speculation in the foreign exchange markets? This paper studies empirically the role of uncertainty in currency crises. Uncertainty, which is measured using the dispersion of survey forecasts of key macroeconomic variables, is found to have a non-monotonic effect on exchange rate pressures: it heightens speculative pressures when expected fundamentals are good and eases them when they are bad. This prediction is consistent with a broad class of currency crisis theories, ranging from first-generation to global-game models. The proposed empirical strategy remains valid in the presence of forecasters with strategic objectives and addresses potential endogeneity bias by building a novel set of instrumental variables."

1158,"AB: In an economy affected by shocks that are imperfectly known, the monetary instrument takes on a dual stabilizing role: as a policy response that directly influences the economy and as a vehicle for information that reveals the central bank's assessment to firms. Because mark-up shocks cannot be neutralized by monetary policy, providing firms with more information about these shocks exacerbates their reaction and creates a larger distortion. Recognizing the signaling role of its instrument, the central bank distorts its policy response in order to optimally shape firms' beliefs. While providing firms with more information is always detrimental to the output gap, it has a more subtle effect on price dispersion depending on whether information is provided through the transparency channel or through the signaling channel. Although more transparency is always detrimental to welfare, the information that is conveyed by the monetary instrument improves welfare when firms' coordination is highly valuable."

The results show that state-dependent pricing is clearly present in a low-inflation environment and that variables measuring the current situation of the firm, especially costs for intermediate products, are important determinants of price adjustments. Compared to purely time-dependent features, the state-dependent variables significantly add to the explanatory power of a price adjustment probability model. Macroeconomic factors are significant but contribute little in terms of the goodness of fit. Furthermore, when taking into account sticky plan models by excluding possibly predetermined price changes, the importance of state-dependent factors becomes even greater."

With career risk only, stationary equilibria resemble those studied by Aiyagari (1994), and the impact of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk is relatively small. With a significant amount of specialization risk, however, stationary equilibria are severely distorted, with human capital about 57 percent as large as its complete markets counterpart."

The risk-aversion coefficient, restricted to be the same across assets in panel regression, is estimated to be between two and four and highly significant. The risk premium induced by the conditional covariation of assets with the market portfolio remains positive and significant after controlling for risk premia induced by conditional covariation with macroeconomic, financial, and volatility factors."

This decline and timing are consistent with other macro and micro observations about growth variability that are collectively referred to as the ""Great Moderation."" The variability of earnings growth is negatively correlated with age at any point in time, and the U.S. working age population got older during this period because the Baby Boom was aging. However, the decrease in variability was roughly uniform across all age groups, so population aging is not the source of the overall decline. The variance of log changes also declined at multi-year frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both permanent and transitory components of earnings shocks became more moderate. A simple identification strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift over time in the stochastic process occurred even after controlling for age effects."

Real rigidities arise and the labor share ceases to be a good proxy for marginal costs. The model replicates the impulse responses of an SVAR for U.S. data better than alternatives in which the real rigidities arising at the firm level are absent. In addition, it implies reasonably low degrees of nominal rigidity whereas the alternatives do not. The interaction of wage and price setting at the firm level is important for the macroeconomic dynamics."

The results of a panel covering 325 manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006 show that imports from nine low-wage countries are associated with strong downward pressure on prices. When these nations capture a 1% share of the U.S. sector, the sector's producer prices decrease by 2.35%. Because import competition also influences the skewness of the distribution of price changes, it is likely to have impacted U.S. equilibrium inflation."

Under country-specific demand and supply disturbances, monetary union stabilisation is hampered by steeper supply slopes, a greater preference for price stability, governments' stronger fiscal objective focus and a higher sensitiveness of aggregate demand to real exchange rates. Sensitivity results are ambiguous for country size. Supply-driven small open economies may benefit from maintaining monetary sovereignty."

This paper informs the debate by developing a modular approach that distinguishes between seigniorage changes a country experiences during the transition phase prior to joining a monetary union and at the time of the regime change when the common currency is introduced. Using the Eurozone enlargement as an example, the underlying components of seigniorage changes for the transition phase and the regime change are identified and quantified. The modular approach thus allows a more informed discussion and provides analysts and policymakers with flexibility as to which seigniorage components to choose depending on the economic issue at hand."

This paper provides recent evidence on the degree of efficiency and economic viability of various sizes of banking institutions and tries to contribute a few policy recommendations to the existing literature. The findings suggest that the largest sized banks are generally the least efficient banks and the smallest sized banks are the most efficient. Inefficiencies range between 20% and 25% across different European banking samples. The strongest economies of scale are displayed by Danish, Italian and Spanish banks (scale economies range between 7% and 10%). The impact of technical change in reducing bank costs (ranging from 2.3% to 5.6% per annum) appears to be systematically increasing with bank size. Overall, the results indicate that the largest banks in our sample enjoy greater benefits from technical progress, although they do not have scale economy and efficiency advantages over smaller banks."

This paper uses a life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents that face idiosyncratic productivity shocks and shows that the tax scheme provides a strong work incentive when households possess large assets and high productivity later in the life-cycle, when they otherwise would work less. The system also adds to the saving motive of prime-age households and raises aggregate capital. The increased economic activities expand the tax base and the revenue neutral reform results in a lower average tax rate. The negative cross-dependence generates a sizable welfare gain in the long-run relative to the tax system that treats labor and capital income separately as a tax base. The reform, however, can hurt the elderly during the transition with a high marginal tax on their capital income."

A calibrated model of endogenous homeownership and consumption is able to reproduce the patterns in the data quite well and provides an interpretation of the empirical results.

1705,"AB: A new method of measuring the degree of consumption smoothing is proposed and implemented using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The structure of this Survey is such that estimators previously used in the literature are inconsistent, simply because income is measured annually and consumption is measured quarterly. An AR(1) structure is imposed on the income process to obtain a proxy for quarterly income through a projection on annual income. By construction, this proxy gives rise to a measurement error which is orthogonal to the proxy itself--as opposed to the unobserved regressor--leading to a consistent estimator. Our estimates are contrasted with the output of two estimators used in the literature. This comparison shows that while the first (OLS) estimator tends to overstate the degree of risk sharing, the second (IV) estimator grossly understates it."

The analysis focuses on two dimensions that are critical for understanding government investment as a fiscal stimulus: implementation delays for building public capital and expected fiscal adjustments to deficit-financed spending. Implementation delays can produce small or even negative labor and output responses to increases in government investment in the short run. Anticipated fiscal adjustments matter both quantitatively and qualitatively for long-run growth effects. When public capital is insufficiently productive, distorting financing can make government investment contractionary at longer horizons."

Using a search model of unemployment with nominal rigidities and variable labor effort, I show that technology shocks can generate a positive unemployment-productivity correlation whereas non-technology shocks (i.e., aggregate demand shocks) tend to do the opposite. In this context, I identify two events that can quantitatively explain the increase in the correlation: (i) a sharp drop in the volatility of non-technology shocks in the mid-1980s, and (ii) a decline in the response of productivity to non-technology shocks, which from procyclical became acyclical in the last 25 years."

A methodology to identify unexploited arbitrage opportunities in financial data is proposed. Observable returns strongly suggest that the money market of the Greenback Era did not systematically admit arbitrage, except possibly around the times of the Gold Corner of 1869 and the Panic of 1873, which implies that Calomiris provides a more plausible explanation."

1777,"AB: Recent empirical research finds that the degree of nominal rigidities varies over monetary policy regimes. This implies that monetary policy analysis with exogenously given nominal rigidities is subject to the Lucas critique. We allow firms to choose the probability of price adjustment in a Calvo-style sticky price model, and analyze how this probability changes according to an inflation coefficient of the Taylor rule. The model shows that a more aggressive monetary policy response to inflation makes firms less likely to reset prices and gives the resulting New Keynesian Phillips curve a flatter slope and a smaller disturbance, as observed during the Volcker-Greenspan era. Also, such a policy response can stabilize both inflation and the output gap by exploiting the feedback effects of this policy response on firms' price-setting. These results offer theoretical support for the good policy hypothesis about the Great Moderation."

But at low per capita incomes average wages respond to food prices, raising costs, and hence domestic prices. Then CPII, for which food is the dominant component, should Granger cause WPII. This reverse causality is derived and finds support in an estimated new Keynesian aggregate supply (AS) framework with the wage-price link. The AS and the identity both hold as long-run cointegrating relationships. The AS is elastic but food prices and the exchange rate are important for inflation."

Results show that financial markets are characterised by two regimes: a bull and a bear market. Besides, correlations appear to be very important in a bear state and significantly different from those in the bull market.

The findings reveal that Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) as well as foreign issue of securities (FS) made insignificant contribution to development of the market compared to other contending factors such as domestic securities investment (DSI) and domestic issue of securities (DS). This appears to constitute a policy challenge, considering the enormous gain that would accrue to the economy from increasing foreign participation in the market. The challenge could be surmounted by liberalising investment laws, offering fiscal incentives, and strengthening surveillance of the market to enhance efficiency."

In this environment, monetary policy plays an important signaling role. This paper highlights this signaling role by showing that conclusions from imperfect information monetary models are sensitive to the number of shocks included. With multiple shocks, contractionary monetary policy can initially increase inflation and delay the eventual disinflation. Moreover, multiple shocks can result in destabilizing price flexibility, while optimal policy's response to one shock will depend on the existence of other shocks, contrary to a typical linear-quadratic framework."

Due to the discrete and lumpy nature of these margins, only a fraction of plants adjust output in response to shocks. In a business cycle model calibrated to establishment-level observations, these nonconvexities make aggregate output less volatile than when plants can adjust smoothly. Further, the mass of adjusting plants is larger in downturns than in upturns, leading to counter-cyclical volatility of aggregate output and government policy being slightly more effective in recessions than in expansions."

327,"AB: To combat the financial crisis that intensified in the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve injected a substantial amount of liquidity into the banking system. The resulting increase in reserve balances exerted downward price pressure in the federal funds market, and the effective federal funds rate began to deviate from the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. In response, the Federal Reserve revised its operational framework for implementing monetary policy and began to pay interest on reserve balances in an attempt to provide a floor for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, following the policy change, the effective federal funds rate remained below not only the target but also the rate paid on reserve balances. We develop a model to explain this phenomenon and use data from the federal funds market to evaluate it empirically. In turn, we show how successful the Federal Reserve may be in raising the federal funds rate even in an environment with substantial reserve balances."

We explain such stress by modeling leveraged banks' precautionary demand for liquidity. Asset shocks impair a bank's ability to roll over debt because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, banks hoard liquidity and decrease term lending as their rollover risk increases over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing. In extremis, inter-bank markets can completely freeze."

We show how systemic liquidity crises of the kind associated with the interbank market collapse of 2007-2008 can arise within such a framework, with funding contagion spreading widely through the web of interlinkages. Our model illustrates how greater complexity and concentration in the financial network may amplify this fragility. The analysis suggests how a range of policy measures--including tougher liquidity regulation, macro-prudential policy, and surcharges for systemically important financial institutions--could make the financial system more resilient."

424,"AB: When a corporation issues debt with a fixed nominal coupon, the real value of future payments decreases with the price level. Forward-looking corporate default decisions therefore depend on monetary policy through its impact on expected inflation. We build a general equilibrium economy with deadweight bankruptcy costs that demonstrates how nominal rigidities in corporate debt create an important role for monetary policy even in the absence of standard nominal frictions such as staggered price setting in the output market. Under a passive nominal interest rate peg, the direct effects of a negative productivity shock combine with deflation to produce strong incentives for corporate default. A debt-deflationary spiral results when there are real costs of financial distress. Inflation targeting eliminates this amplification mechanism but full inflation targeting requires permitting the nominal interest rate to depend explicitly on credit market conditions."

We study the effects of this program and find that it lowered interest rate spreads for some categories of asset-backed securities but had little impact on the pricing of individual securities. These findings suggest that the program improved conditions in securitization markets but did not subsidize individual securities. We also find that the risk of loss to the US government was small."

The cumulative abnormal return around the acquisition announcement is lower for acquiring firms with high EBC.

Our results suggest that high EBC acquirers experience lower sensitivity to size and momentum factors that unexpectedly lowers the cost of equity, leading to higher returns."

The study employs approximate entropy statistics to examine the non-linear dependence. We also estimate the Tsay statistics to test for non-linearity. The empirical results provide the evidence of strong non-linear dependence in the Indian exchange rate returns and volatility and also that is time-varying. The results also suggest that the GARCH model, which has been used in the study, is misspecified. The evidence of non-linearity has serious implications for asset pricing, risk management and policy making."

A metaphor for such profit driven fluctuations are gold rushes, as they are periods of economic boom associated with expenditures aimed at securing claims near new found veins of gold. An attractive feature of the model is its capacity to provide a simple structural interpretation to the properties of a standard consumption and output Vector Autoregression."

This introduces new elements, including a two-sector structure with centralized and decentralized markets, stochastic trading opportunities, and bargaining. These elements matter quantitatively and numerical results differ from findings in the reduced-form literature.

753,"AB: Central banks' projections--i.e. forecasts conditional on a given interest rate path--are often criticized on the grounds that their assumptions are inconsistent with the existence of a unique equilibrium in many forward-looking models. The present paper describes three alternative approaches to constructing projections that are not subject to the above criticism, using the New Keynesian model as a reference framework. The three approaches are shown to generate different projections for inflation and output, even though they imply an identical path for the interest rate. The latter result calls into question the meaning and usefulness of such projections."

This paper investigates the process through which credit is reallocated across US businesses employing the methodology developed by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) for the analysis of job reallocation. We find that credit reallocation is intense, highly volatile and moderately procyclical and that it primarily occurs across firms similar in size, industry or location. The results suggest that microeconomic heterogeneity can play a key role in the interaction between the credit market and the aggregate economy."

The results contradict the first claim and imply that the second claim is not general. The model is also used to compute the predicted effects of an investment tax incentive that has figured prominently in recent fiscal stimulus packages."

Household survey data for Mexico reveal that individuals who switched industry or occupation during the 1994-1995 crisis lost about 10% of their hourly earnings on average compared to similar workers who did not move. This suggests that many workers became less productive in the process of migrating to different economic activities. These productivity losses, in turn, can explain about 40% of the observed fall in TFP in Mexico in 1995."

Our theory is that low-skilled workers get relatively less insurance from their firms because they have relatively lower displacement costs. Under limited commitment, lower displacement costs make the workers' outside options more attractive, and hence decrease the amount of risk sharing sustainable within the firm. Evidence on average displacement costs by industry support the theory's predictions."

Money growth and Taylor rule shocks both have nontrivial real effects, because the low state dependence implied by the data rules out the strong selection effect associated with fixed menu costs. The response to sector-specific shocks is gradual, but inappropriate econometrics might make it appear immediate."

We incorporate disembodied technological progress and on-the-job search into the endogenous job separation model of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Because we include on-the-job search, faster growth reduces unemployment by decreasing job separation and inducing job creation. The incorporation of on-the-job search substantially improves the ability of the Mortensen and Pissarides model to explain the effect of growth on labor market variables. Specifically, our model generates not only an empirically consistent sign of the effect, but also a larger impact of growth on unemployment than the standard matching model."

On the basis of the estimated macroeconomic transmission, we argue in favour of using an interest rate rule to achieve price stability. Furthermore, the inflation response to shocks is found to be highly persistent, which points to a strong need for active macroeconomic policy to maintain price stability. The increase in interest rates after 2000 strongly contributed to resuming of the disinflation trend. While the exchange rate was roughly neutral, a moderately negative output-gap, falling oil prices and inflation expectations also contributed to disinflation."

The results of the study suggest that the PPP hypothesis with its strict symmetry and proportionality condition does not hold in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Firms, therefore, have an incentive to promise low prices in the future, but price gouge when the future arrives. In this setting, firms benefit from ""committing to a sticky price."" If consumers have incomplete information about costs and demand, the firm-preferred equilibrium has the firm price at or below a ""price cap."" The model therefore provides an explanation for the simultaneous existence of a rigid regular price and frequent ""sales""."

Using a new dataset, this paper tests whether gold-standard adherence was negatively correlated with the cost of capital. Conditional on UK risk factors, there is no evidence that the bonds issued by countries off gold earned systematically higher excess returns than the bonds issued by countries on gold. This conclusion is robust to allowing betas to differ across exchange-rate regimes, to including other determinants of the country risk premium, and to controlling for the British Empire effect."

A favorable news shock leads to an increase in consumption and decreases in output, hours, and investment on impact--more suggestive of standard DSGE models than of recent extensions designed to generate news-driven business cycles. Though news shocks account for a significant fraction of output fluctuations at medium frequencies, they contribute little to our understanding of recessions."

Quantile regression has been employed to investigate whether traditional theories, such as the lack of arbitrage due to nontradability or imperfect competition combined with price stickiness, are able to account for the slow reversion to parity of RERs."

Monetary policy--expanding reserves by buying Treasuries--transfers all revenue from money creation directly to the fiscal authorities. Credit policy--selling Treasuries to fund loans or acquire non-Treasury securities--is debt-financed fiscal policy. Interest on reserves frees monetary policy to fund credit policy independently of interest rate policy. An ambiguous boundary of responsibilities between the Fed and the fiscal authorities contributed to economic collapse in fall 2008. ""Accord"" principles are proposed to clarify Fed credit policy powers and secure its independence on monetary and interest rate policy. The Fed needs more surplus capital from the fiscal authorities to be fully flexible against both inflation and deflation at the zero interest bound."

We then use the model to evaluate the effects of the central bank using unconventional monetary policy to combat a simulated financial crisis. We interpret unconventional monetary policy as expanding central bank credit intermediation to offset a disruption of private financial intermediation. Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced."

59,"AB: Replicating the flexible price allocation in models with nominal rigidities and labor market frictions that lead to an inefficient matching of unemployed workers with job vacancies, even if feasible, is generally not desirable. We characterize the tax instruments that implement the first best allocation and examine the trade-offs faced by monetary policy if these tax instruments are unavailable. Our tax interpretation helps explain why the welfare cost of inefficient labor market search can be large while the incentive to deviate from price stability is small. Gains from deviating from price stability are larger in economies with more volatile labor flows."

75,"AB: Using data on border enforcement and macroeconomic indicators from the U.S. and Mexico, we estimate a two-country business cycle model of labor migration and remittances. The model matches the cyclical dynamics of unskilled migration, and documents the insurance role of remittances in consumption smoothing. Over the cycle, immigration increases with the expected stream of future wage gains, but it is dampened by a sunk emigration cost. Migration barriers slow the adjustment of the stock of immigrant labor, enhancing the volatility of unskilled wages and remittances. Changes in border enforcement have asymmetric welfare implications for the skilled and unskilled households."

Hires, quits, and layoffs exhibit strong, highly nonlinear relationships to employer growth rates in the cross section. Simple statistical models of these relationships greatly improve our ability to account for fluctuations in aggregate worker flows and enable us to construct synthetic measures of hires, separations, quits, and layoffs back to 1990."

123,AB: Conventional macro-search models (Mortensen and Pissarides) with unemployment benefits and taxes have been able to account for the variation in unemployment rates across countries but do not account for the role geographic mobility or commuting time might play. We build a model in which both unemployment and mobility rates are endogenous. Our findings indicate that an increase in unemployment benefits and in taxes does not generate a strong decline in mobility but does increase unemployment as in the standard model. We find that with higher commuting costs the effect of housing frictions plays a large role and can generate a substantial decline in mobility.

I argue that this conclusion is not supported by the data. Using the same data on hours worked, I find evidence that labor market frictions are higher in Europe than in the US, like Ohanian and Raffo, but also that these frictions seem to affect the intensive margin at least as much as the extensive margin of labor adjustment."

Calibrating unemployment benefits to approximate legislation before and after the reforms, we find a large reduction in unemployment and its duration, with the transition concluding after about three years. During the crisis, the extended use of short-time labor subsidies that prevent jobs from being destroyed is likely to have prevented strong increases in unemployment."

Nevertheless, welfare gains are higher when the U.S. tax system is replaced by a proportional, gender-neutral income tax."

We use the Johansen procedure of cointegration to estimate the long-run stationary relationship between an Australian monetary aggregate (M3) and the explanatory variables. We use the GARCH (1, 1) model to construct an economic uncertainty index. When we account for economic uncertainty, our results establish a long-run equilibrium relationship for the post-deregulation and for the entire sample period, and show an improvement in excess liquidity. Our result has an implication for reopening an important policy question on the viability of framing monetary policy around monetary aggregate."

Inflation dynamics in short-run inflation were influenced by inertia, labour costs, foreign market competitiveness, production as well as some exogenous shocks. We also investigate the direct relationship between inflation and government deficit, however, there seems to be no interdependency between these variables in the long run."

Although the ANNs technique is not very common in economic discipline, the results are expected to be more accurate in terms of market timing ability and sign prediction than those of the standard econometric techniques such as ARMA. ANNs are, in fact, capable of dealing with high-frequency data as well as the nonlinearities in exchange rate movements. Our results support the notion that ANNs is an effective method in forecasting the exchange rates. The NARX networks output shows a significant market timing ability. Both FF and NARX proved to forecast at a higher accuracy (sign prediction) than random walk and ARMA models."

344,"AB: When a bank is deemed 'too big to fail' by regulators, it may be tempted to buy risky assets. This paper analyses bank bailouts involving the purchases of toxic assets, preferred stock and common stock when the government wants to encourage efficient lending. It finds that preferred stock recapitalisations are the least efficient in correcting debt overhang problems from both an ex post and ex ante perspective. In contrast, efficient lending and voluntary participation can be best achieved without subsidy by purchasing either toxic assets or common stock. Nevertheless, troubled banks must be subsidised if they will voluntarily participate in any recapitalisation."

For this purpose, we make use of two different procedures viz. the Lee and Strazicich (2003) unit root test as well as the Bai and Perron (1998, 2003a, 2003b) methodology, which both enable us to determine unknown structural breaks endogenously from the data and we find evidence of two structural breaks in our series owing to the burst of the new economy bubble in 2001 and the global financial and economic crisis around 2007. Moreover, we illustrate that these breaks have affected the parameters of the money demand as well. Furthermore, we check if our demand for broad money with time-varying coefficients helps to improve p-star model based inflation forecasts and show that our forecasts outmatch those resulting from a fixed coefficient approach."

We demonstrate our conjecture by using data from post-revolutionary Iran and the bounds testing approach.

The proposed approach can jointly determine the number of structural breaks in a series of tail-indexes and estimate the mean tail-index levels in different regimes. Here we advocate a modified Hill estimator for the tail index. We provide simulations that indicate good finite sample properties of our procedure. The proposed method is then applied to the tail behaviour returns of two international stock market indices, SP500 (USA) and CAC40 (France). The results indicate that procedures perform reasonably well and lead to an appropriate number of breaks with locations coinciding with major financial crisis and events such as the LTCM crisis, September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, sub-prime crisis in 2008 and European Union (EU) debt crisis triggered on 2010."

427,"AB: This paper explores optimal monetary policy when current account dynamics is taken into consideration in a sticky-price intertemporal optimising model. It investigates how monetary policies affect current account movement in a two-country model. The main issues addressed include: 1) what factors affect the current account dynamics in response to technology and monetary shocks in a two-country open economy, 2) how should the monetary authority respond to these shocks to maximise the welfare of the household. Using a non-linear solution method, we find that the current account dynamics depends critically on the intratemporal and intertemporal elasticities of substitution, the degree of monopolistic competition, the degree of Local Currency Pricing (LCP) and the type of shocks. With sluggish price adjustment among firms, the home monetary authority will choose an expansionary monetary policy when facing a home technological improvement. If a supranational monetary authority is to choose an optimal monetary policy for both countries, the welfare gain from the expansionary monetary policy for both home and foreign counties is quantitatively small."

Sovereign debtors and their private creditors should therefore meet in order for them to arrange a financial package including debt restructuring, rescheduling and cancellation. In this study we argue in favour of a European political union in the form of a federation of states, with its own taxation powers and some financial equalisation transfer mechanisms, to be coupled with a proactive investment policy carried out by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the issue of euro-bonds to channel global savings into an investment-led European Economic Recovery Plan."

We claim that many European countries, including Greece and other countries of Southern Europe remain unable to afford the vulnerable and one-sided, weak political and economic European monetary context. Additionally, we claim that unless deep governance structures emerge, a possible enlargement of the Eurozone could create more costs than benefits for both the candidate members and the Eurozone itself."

489,"AB: This paper uses the Mankiw and Weinzierl (2011) general equilibrium model of optimal stabilisation policy to ask how macroeconomic outcomes are affected by membership in a monetary union. The model agrees with much of the previous literature that the effects of various shocks may be amplified or dampened depending on how the common central bank responds, or fails to respond, to them. This in turn depends on how well (or poorly) correlated the domestic shocks are with their union-wide counterparts. For example, a negative spending shock will be the most recessionary when the shock is confined to the domestic economy, much less (if at all) recessionary when the shock is union wide, and actually expansionary if the shock is restricted to the rest of the union. Fiscal and productivity shocks are characterised by similar properties."

We show that the specification of investment adjustment costs proposed by Christiano et al. (2005) predicts the presence of a lagged-investment effect and that a generalized version of their model is consistent with the behavior of firm-level data from Compustat.

In this case, if nonhedonic prices are sticky, sticker prices should fall at the rate of quality growth."

Martingales characterize alternative probability specifications and clarify distinctions among the three types of ambiguity. We use recursive formulations of Ramsey problems to impose local predictability of commitment multipliers directly. To reduce the dimension of the state in a recursive formulation, we transform the commitment multiplier to accommodate the heterogeneous beliefs that arise with ambiguity of types II and III. Our formulations facilitate comparisons of the consequences of these alternative types of ambiguity."

Optimal monetary policy is affected during the crisis and in normal times, as policymakers guard against the possibility of crises. In the estimated model, this effect is quite small. Optimal policy does change substantially during a crisis, but uncertainty about crises has relatively little effect."

We show how to characterize robustly optimal policy without restricting consideration a priori to a particular parametric family of candidate policy rules. We show that robustly optimal policy can be implemented through commitment to a target criterion involving only the paths of inflation and a suitably defined output gap, but that a concern for robustness requires greater resistance to surprise increases in inflation than would be considered optimal if one could count on the private sector to have ""rational expectations."""

Therefore, if excess liquidity is a cause of market inefficiency, the latter is expected to come out essentially in restrictive monetary environments. Consistent with this intuition, empirical tests here highlight that expected stock returns in the USA are driven by fundamentals only in expansive monetary phases whereas investor sentiment seems to be the most important driving force in restrictive monetary environments."

The release of information arouses investor interest for the involved securities. Thus, trading frequency increases, although larger-sized transactions, which should denote possible portfolio rebalancing, are not observed. In the short-term market, trading volumes are found to fade after reviews for downgrade."

The results of the study show that economic growth is explained by the financial sector variables and control variables such as inflation, exchange rate, and real interest rates. The Granger causality test results show that there is generally a bidirectional relationship between economic growth and financial sector development which implies that if the economy grows the financial services sector also grows and vice versa."

In a standard structural VAR, an empirical measure of confidence does not significantly react to spending shocks and output multipliers are around one. In a non-linear VAR, confidence rises following an increase in spending during periods of economic slack and multipliers are much larger. The systematic response of confidence is irrelevant for the output multiplier during normal times, but is critical during recessions. Spending shocks during downturns predict productivity improvements through a persistent increase in government investment relative to consumption, which is reflected in higher confidence."

Technological change, in the form of increased importance of intangible capital in production, sharpens the borrowing constraints of entrepreneurs, leading to a scarcity of high-yield assets relative to low-yield ones. This can create the conditions for asset bubbles. Additionally, due to the financial frictions, standard dynamic efficiency tests are not valid, and bubbles are not Pareto improving."

This is because they increase the market value of existing capital and households require a higher return to hold this additional wealth.

This paper challenges the conventional view by finding a stable demand for M1 in U.S. data from 1959 through 1993. The approach follows previous work in interpreting long-run money demand as a cointegrating relation, and it uses Goldfeld's partial-adjustment model to interpret short-run dynamics. The key innovation is the choice of the interest rate in the money demand function. Most previous work uses a short-term market rate, but this paper uses the average return on ""near monies""-the savings accounts and money market mutual funds that are close substitutes for M1. This choice helps rationalize the behavior of money demand, in particular, the increase in the volatility of velocity after 1980 is explained by increased volatility in the returns on near monies."

The parameters governing preferences and technology are estimated by maximum likelihood using macroeconomic data and the term structure of interest rates. The estimates imply a large risk aversion, an elasticity of intertemporal substitution higher than one, and substantial adjustment costs. Furthermore, the paper identifies the tensions within the model by estimating it on subsets of these data. The analysis concludes by pointing out potential extensions that may improve the model's fit."

The 'competition effect' implies that entry lowers desired markups and dampens inflation. Under translog preferences, where the substitutability between goods depends on their number, we find evidence of such an effect. That model generates more countercyclical markups than Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) monopolistic competition model, where price stickiness is the only source of markup fluctuations. In contrast, a model with strategic interactions between oligopolistic firms cannot generate an empirically relevant competition effect and is statistically equivalent to the Dixit-Stiglitz model."

1281,"AB: We analyze the impact of globalization on individual gains from trade in a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition featuring product diversity, pro-competitive effects, and income heterogeneity between and within countries. Although trade reduces markups in both countries in our framework, its impact on variety depends on their relative position in the world income distribution: product diversity in the lower income country always expands, while that in the higher income country may shrink. When the latter occurs, the richer consumers in the higher income country may lose from trade because the relative importance of variety versus quantity increases with income. Using data on GDP per capita and population, as well as on the U.S. income distribution, our theoretical results are illustrated in two different contexts: the hypothetical bilateral trade liberalization between the U.S. and 188 countries, and the historical sequence of U.S. free trade agreements since 1985."

In this paper, we integrate a microfounded model of money and finance into a model of endogenous growth to examine the effects of inflation on welfare, growth, and the size of the financial sector. A novel feature is that the innovation sector is decentralized. Financial intermediaries arise endogenously to provide liquidity to this sector. Consistent with the data but in contrast to previous work, reducing inflation generates large growth gains. These large gains cannot be easily reproduced by imposing a cash-in-advance constraint in the innovation sector."

These time varying worst case scenarios capture a notion of animal spirits where the probability distributions used to evaluate decision rules and price assets do not necessarily reflect the fundamental characteristics of the economy. Households entertain a pessimistic view of the world and their pessimism varies with the overall level of volatility in the economy, implying an amplification of the effects of volatility shocks.

In particular, the extent of portfolio rebalancing and consumption smoothing are influenced by the presence of non-convex portfolio adjustment costs. Suppose bonds can be adjusted costlessly while adjustments to stock accounts entail adjustment costs. Due to these portfolio adjustment costs, the household demands both stocks and bonds. A household can buffer some income fluctuations without incurring adjustment costs and engage in costly portfolio rebalancing less frequently. Using the estimated preference parameters and portfolio adjustment costs, the response to income and return shocks is nonlinear and reflects the interaction of portfolio rebalancing and consumption smoothing."

Estimation of a DSGE model shows that these results reflect changes in the degree of wage indexation over time, which was considerably higher during the ""Great Inflation""."

The consequence of this preference is that there are three monetary policy regimes, and these regimes differ in which assets serve as media of exchange, whether assets carry a liquidity premium, and in the impact that monetary policy has on asset prices."

In the model, some workers move to, or stay in, a location with high unemployment because they are more productive there than elsewhere.

The results show that the weights of the 12 indicators as reported by Essayyad et al. in 2009 are different from those weights as reported in 2012. The difference in the results can be attributed to the changes in the values of economic and financial variables due to 2008 economic/market collapse, natural disasters including droughts, escalating cost of wars, and the subsequent recession that prevailed in OECD member countries. The aforementioned factors and the persistent increase in national debt have affected the international value of the US dollar.

We estimate a variant of bank loan demand and supply model using a structural vector error correction (SVEC) model to deal with fundamental issue of identification problems. The empirical findings of the bank lending channel from these countries suggest that bank loans decline following the monetary contraction, consistent with the credit channel view. However, it is not clear whether the credit supply is really the binding constraint using the aggregate data, in the event that both credit supply and demand felt simultaneously following monetary policy shock. The results from the aggregate data cannot fully explain the monetary transmission via credit channel. Hence, employing firm-level data approach may shed further insights on the credit channel transmission mechanism."

The novelty of our analysis lies in fact that, on the basis of this assumption about the central bank's preferences, we evaluate its stabilisation effort under different scenarios of fiscal policy discipline and coordination in the union. We find that the level of conservativeness of the central bank decreases, while the presence of institutions and tools for the control and the coordination enforcement of fiscal policies are still required. Governments' lack of coordination reduces the fiscal policies stabilisation effort of the central bank, but it increases the monetary authority's reaction to supply shocks."

When decomposing the VIX into two components, a proxy for risk aversion and expected stock market volatility (""uncertainty""), we find that a lax monetary policy decreases both risk aversion and uncertainty, with the former effect being stronger. The result holds in a structural vector autoregressive framework, controlling for business cycle movements and using a variety of identification schemes for the vector autoregression in general and monetary policy shocks in particular. The effect of monetary policy on risk aversion is also apparent in regressions using high frequency data."

The market consists of a small number of suppliers who make depletion plans based on their perceptions of how sensitive price is to supply. Learning leads to changes in these perceptions and hence the revision of depletion plans, which can have a dramatic effect on market supply and price. Firstly, price trends upwards faster than the rate of time preference as the non-renewable resource approaches exhaustion. Secondly, there are frequent escape episodes in which price rises rapidly before gradually falling back. The striking volatility and nonstationarity in commodity prices that results has parallels in oil price data."

This paper finds similarly small renegotiation rates for securitized loans and loans held on banks' balance sheets that become seriously delinquent, in particular during the early part of the financial crisis. We argue that information issues endemic to home mortgages, where lenders negotiate with large numbers of borrowers, lead to barriers in renegotiation. Consistent with the theory, renegotiation rates are strongly negatively correlated with the degree of informational asymmetries between borrowers and lenders over the course of the crisis."

In this paper, we analyze to what extent downward wage rigidities can explain these empirical business cycle asymmetries. To this aim, we introduce asymmetric wage adjustment costs in a New-Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market. Increasing wages is less costly than cutting them. It follows that wages increase relatively fast and thus limit vacancy posting and employment creation, but they decline more slowly, leading to a strong reduction in vacancies and employment. The presence of downward wage rigidities strongly improves the fit of the model to the observed skewness of labor market variables and the relative length of expansions and contractions in the output and the employment cycles. The asymmetry also explains the differing transmission of positive and negative monetary policy shocks from wages to inflation."

227,"AB: The large, persistent fluctuations in international trade that cannot be explained in standard models by changes in expenditures and relative prices are often attributed to trade wedges. We show that these trade wedges can reflect the decisions of importers to change their inventory holdings. We find that a two-country model of international business cycles with an inventory management decision can generate trade flows and wedges consistent with the data. Moreover, matching trade flows alters the international transmission of business cycles. Specifically, real net exports become countercyclical and consumption is less correlated across countries than in standard models. We also show that ignoring inventories as a source of trade wedges substantially overstates the role of trade wedges in business cycle fluctuations."

289,AB: This paper investigates whether the international globalization of financial markets allows for significant cross-country risk-sharing at the business cycle frequency. We find that cross-country risk-sharing is still limited and this is unlikely to be the result of financial frictions that limit state-contingent contracts. Part of the limited international risk sharing could be the consequence of frictions that de-facto reduce the short-term mobility of financial capital. But even with these frictions we find significant divergence between model predictions and the data.

Likewise, under financial integration unconventional policies aimed at stabilizing domestic financial and credit conditions could entail large international spillovers. Therefore, stabilization by one country will also benefit other countries, reducing incentives to implement credit policies in a classic free-riding problem, especially when these policies entail domestic costs. We show that this outcome can emerge in an open economy model featuring financial intermediaries that face endogenously determined balance sheet constraints."

352,"AB: I analyze a model with moral hazard and limited enforcement in a small open economy. I find that when state contingent contracting is allowed adding the moral hazard friction improves the model's predictions along several dimensions. First, it justifies why non-contingent debt is an optimal way to finance an emerging economy. Second, it explains the limited consumption risk-sharing and high, volatile, and counter-cyclical interest rates. Third, it generates realistic crisis-like dynamics in which capital inflows are brought to a halt and interest rates sky-rocket. The model also has a strong internal propagation mechanism. Limited enforcement friction, alone or together with moral hazard, has nearly no effect on the model's performance. I also construct a simple empirical test to distinguish between the two frictions and it favors moral hazard over limited enforcement friction."

383,"AB: This paper analyzes the behavior of international capital flows by foreign and domestic agents, dubbed gross capital flows, over the business cycle and during financial crises. We show that gross capital flows are very large and volatile, especially relative to net capital flows. When foreigners invest in a country, domestic agents invest abroad, and vice versa. Gross capital flows are also pro-cyclical. During expansions, foreigners invest more domestically and domestic agents invest more abroad. During crises, total gross flows collapse and there is a retrenchment in both inflows by foreigners and outflows by domestic agents. These patterns hold for different types of capital flows and crises. This evidence sheds light on the sources of fluctuations driving capital flows and helps discriminate among existing theories. Our findings seem consistent with crises affecting domestic and foreign agents asymmetrically, as would be the case under the presence of sovereign risk or asymmetric information."

448,"AB: Over the past 25 years, real average hourly wages in the United States have become substantially more volatile relative to output. Microdata from the Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to show that this increase in relative volatility is predominantly due to increases in the relative volatility of hourly wages across different groups of workers. Compositional changes of the workforce, by contrast, account for only a small fraction of the increase in relative wage volatility. Simulations with a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model illustrate that the observed increase in relative wage volatility is unlikely to come from changes outside of the labor market (e.g., smaller exogenous shocks or more aggressive monetary policy). By contrast, greater flexibility in wage setting due to deunionization and a shift towards performance-pay contracts as experienced by the U.S. labor market is capable of accounting for a substantial fraction of the observed increase in relative wage volatility. Greater wage flexibility also decreases the magnitude of business cycle fluctuations, suggesting an interesting new explanation for the Great Moderation."

Instead, this ""volatility of volatility"" relates to the business cycle.

536,"AB: This paper sheds light on two problems in the Penn World Table (PWT) GDP estimates. First, we show that these estimates vary substantially across different versions of the PWT despite being derived from very similar underlying data and using almost identical methodologies, that the methodology deployed to estimate growth rates leads to systematic variability, which is greater: at higher data frequencies, for smaller countries, and the farther the estimate from the benchmark year. Moreover, this variability matters for the cross-country growth literature. While growth studies that use low frequency data remain robust to data revisions, studies that use annual data are less robust. Second, the PWT methodology leads to GDP estimates that are not valued at purchasing power parity (PPP) prices. This is surprising because the raison d'etre of the PWT is to adjust national estimates of GDP by valuing output at common international (purchasing power parity [PPP]) prices so that the resulting PPP-adjusted estimates of GDP are comparable across countries. We propose an approach to address these two problems of variability and valuation."

602,"AB: The current paper attempts to analyse the causality and co-integration relationship between the global financial crisis and the general stock price index (SPI) in the Jordanian equity market for the 1978-2011 period. A vector error correction model (VECM) is utilised to test the causal relationship between SPI and its determinants [gross domestic product (GDP), money supply (M2), exchange rate (EX) and consumer price index (CPI)]. The results identify a co-integration between SPI and Jordanian macroeconomic variables indicating a long-run equilibrium relationship among them. The error-correction term coefficient has a significant negative sign pointed to the adjustment back from short-run disequilibrium to the long-run equilibrium. The Granger causality test suggests a bidirectional causal relationship between SPI and M2 in the short and long runs. In addition, the results reveal that the global financial crisis has a positive significant impact on the SPI."

To do so, this paper constructs two individual data sets: the Asian data set containing US firms with Asian operations for the Asian crisis and the Mexican data set of the firms with Mexican operations for the Mexican crisis. It is found that industry-level exchange exposure of both data sets tends to be more significantly estimated during the crises rather than before the crises. In addition, regarding exchange rate changes type, the exposures of the Asian data set tend to be more significantly estimated with the simple exchange rate changes based on the random-walk assumption whereas the exposures of the Mexican data set tend to be more significantly estimated with the GARCH(1,1)-processed standard deviations of exchange rate."

This paper considers the effects of three credit risk transfer instruments--securitised assets, secondary market syndicated loans, and credit derivatives--on the credit channel of the transmission mechanism. With alternative funding opportunities, a new theoretical framework focuses on the ability of monetary policy to impact the financial condition of banks as borrowers in credit markets. Evidence of the credit channel is tested for in a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. The results show no support for the existence of a traditional bank lending channel that functions through deposits and the supply of bank credit but demonstrate credit channel effects in higher bank funding costs, which are passed on to bank business loan and nonbank commercial mortgage borrowers. The results suggest that credit risk transfer has transformed some credit markets so that monetary policy remains effective through the cost of credit."

Implicit in this recommendation is the availability of a lump-sum tax instrument. In this paper, I view lump-sum tax obligations as a form of debt subject to default. While individuals may want to honor such obligations ex ante, a lack of commitment (the sine qua non of modern monetary theory) may prevent them from the following through on their promises ex post. When this is the case, there may exist an incentive-induced limit to deflationary policy."

We treat the bankruptcy costs facing intermediaries in a costly state verification problem as a stochastic process, and model the boom-bust in terms of an unfulfilled news-shock where the expected fall in costs are eventually not realized. In response to a change in expectations only, the model generates a boom-bust cycle in aggregate activity, asset prices and leverage, and a countercyclical credit spread."

719,"AB: When lenders cannot force borrowers to repay debts, assets are often pledged to secure loans. In this paper, borrowers lose collateral once they renege on debts, and exclusion of defaulters occurs probabilistically, with a higher probability implying better enforcement. Increased efficiency in enforcement reduces asset prices, while raising loan-to-value ratios. If the rise in loan-to-value ratios is the dominant effect, aggregate liquidity and output increase with the advance in enforcement. Inflation raises the repayment cost by increasing the loan rate, while raising the default cost through exclusion. Consequently, inflation raises loan-to-value ratios and output only when enforcement is sufficiently efficient."

The impact is stronger during the period of tight monetary policy, particularly for smaller firms and firms without banking relationships. Debt inflexibility increases the sensitivity of cash holdings to cash flows, reduces the likelihood of dividend payment and makes the firm more likely to pay equity in mergers and acquisitions."

At the same time, an econometrician would expect an increase in the home currency value. Together, the model with investor misperception can account for the forward premium puzzle. In addition, misperception helps lower the correlation between consumption growth differentials and exchange rate growth.

In those models, the only uncertainty affecting money demand is aggregate. We investigate a model with uninsurable idiosyncratic uncertainty about liquidity need.

A model with heterogeneous, infinitely lived households and competitive housing and mortgage markets is constructed to evaluate this question. Households can default on their mortgages via foreclosure. The bailout guarantee is a tax-financed mortgage interest rate subsidy. Eliminating this subsidy leads to a large decline in mortgage origination and increases aggregate welfare by 0.5% in consumption equivalent variation, but has little effect on foreclosure rates and housing investment. The interest rate subsidy is a regressive policy: it hurts low-income and low-asset households."

It is moreover found that forecasters have predictable forecast errors. These facts are qualitatively supportive of recent models of inattention and suggest a setup where agents imperfectly process information due to both sticky information a la Mankiw-Reis, and noisy information a la Sims. However, building and estimating such an expectation model, we find that it cannot quantitatively replicate the error and disagreement observed in the data."

This paper considers a disaggregated framework: an economy with corporate and dividend taxes, where firms invest in both tangible and intangible assets (which can be expensed or sweat). In our setup, firms can always respond to changes in the timing of taxation. We find that the optimal long-run policy features zero corporate taxes and positive dividend taxes, with labor and dividend taxes being identical. Moreover, the initial capital levy is relatively small."

Evidence as well suggests a negative relationship between external governance and the microbanks' social success measured by the depth of outreach. In this context, our analysis reveals that a country's political stability, governance effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law are significant key elements of external governance affecting the MFIs' functional performance. Moreover, results from sensitivity analyses indicate that the relationship between external governance quality and microfinance functional performance significantly depends on the microbanks' business concepts, their lending methodologies and sources of funding."

We find a positive relationship between capitalisation and liquidity and bank efficiency. On the other hand, the results suggest a negative relationship between credit risk and overhead expenses and bank efficiency. The results indicate a positive relationship between business and monetary freedoms and bank efficiency, while the relationship between technical efficiency and financial freedom seems to be negative."

We empirically test this hypothesis on a dataset of Italian provinces, and address the possible endogeneity of corruption by applying an IV model. We use three sets of historical instruments for corruption: 1) foreign dominations that ruled Italian regions between the 16th and 17th century, 2) autocracy/autonomous rule in the 14th century, 3) an index of social capital between the end of the 19th and at the onset of the 20th century. The results confirm the validity of the set of instruments (2) and (3), and indicate a significant impact of historically driven corruption on development."

Recently, a theoretical connection has been suggested to highlight that corruption and crime can be considered strategic complements. This paper, therefore, delves into the link between corruption and crime investigating empirically this relation for Italian regions in the period 1996-2005. Results show that current crime is positively associated with past levels of corruption. This somehow confirms the complementary relationship between the two illicit phenomena."

1096,"AB: Using a sample of the 48 mainland US states for the period 1973-2009, we study the ability of US states to expand their own state employment through the use of state deficit policies. The analysis allows for the facts that US states are part of a wider monetary and economic union with free factor mobility across all states and that state residents and firms may purchase goods from ""neighboring"" states. Those purchases may generate economic spillovers across neighbors. Estimates suggest that states can increase their own state employment by increasing their own deficits. There is evidence of spillovers to employment in neighboring states defined by common cyclical patterns among state economies. For large states, aggregate spillovers to its economic neighbors are approximately two-thirds of the large state's job growth. Because of significant spillovers and possible incentives to free-ride, there is a potential case to actively coordinate (i.e., centralize) the management of stabilization policies. Finally, the job effects of a temporary increase in state own deficits persist for at most one to two years, and there is evidence of a negative impact on state jobs when these deficits are scheduled for repayment."

According to our benchmark estimates, average state and local government employment, during the 24 months following the program's inception, was between 156,000 and 563,000 persons greater as a result of ARRA spending (90% confidence interval). The corresponding estimate for the private sector ranges from a loss of 182,000 to a gain of 1.1 million jobs. Our point estimate for the implied cost of creating a job lasting one year is $202,000, which is substantially larger than the corresponding estimate from the President's Council of Economic Advisors."

1163,"AB: The efficient decentralized provision of public goods requires that special interest groups, such as municipal unions, do not exercise undue influence on the outcome of municipal elections and local fiscal policies. We develop a new political economy model in which a union can endorse one of the candidates in a local election. A politician that prefers an inefficiently large public sector can, therefore, win an election if the union can provide sufficiently strong support during the campaign. We have assembled a unique data set that is based on union endorsements that are published in leading local newspapers. Our empirical analysis focuses on municipal elections in the 150 largest cities in the U.S. between 1990 and 2012. We find that challengers strongly benefit from endorsements in competitive elections. Challengers that receive union endorsements and successfully defeat an incumbent also tend to adopt more union friendly fiscal policies."

Unlike traditional tax-exempt municipals, BABs are taxable to the holder, but the Treasury rebates 35% of the coupon to the issuer. The stated purpose was to provide municipalities access to a more liquid market including foreign, tax-exempt, and tax-deferred investors. We find BABs do not exhibit greater liquidity than traditional municipals. BABs are more underpriced initially, particularly for interdealer trades. BABs also show a substitution from underwriter fees toward more underpricing, suggesting that the underpricing is a strategic response to the tax subsidy."

The evidence that characteristics dominate covariances in horse races does not necessarily mean mispricing, measurement errors in covariances are likely to blame.

When agriculture relies on traditional technology, industrial development reduces the relative price of industrial products, but has a limited effect on per capita income because most labor has to remain in farming. Growth is not sustainable until this relative price drops below a certain threshold, thus inducing farmers to adopt modern technology that employs industry-supplied inputs. Once agricultural modernization begins, per capita income emerges from stasis and accelerates toward modern growth. Our calibrated model is largely consistent with the set of historical data we have compiled on the English economy, accounting well for the growth experience of England encompassing the Industrial Revolution."

In this paper, we present a model where workers (females and males) are subject to idiosyncratic employment risk and where capital markets are incomplete. A household is formed by a female and a male, who decide on consumption, savings, and labor supplies. In a calibrated version of our model, we find that intra-household risk sharing has its largest impact among wealth-poor households. While the wealth-rich use mainly savings to smooth consumption across unemployment spells, wealth-poor households rely on spousal labor supply. For instance, for low-wealth households, average hours worked by wives of unemployed husbands are 8% higher than those worked by wives of employed husbands. This response in wives' hours makes up 9% of lost family income. We also study consumption losses upon an unemployment spell, precautionary savings and the crowding out effects of the public unemployment insurance program on the extent of risk sharing within the household."

1413,"AB: This paper provides a theory of financial frictions as a transmission mechanism for news shocks to drive aggregate TFP fluctuations. We show that in an economy calibrated to U.S. data, variations in financial frictions on capital allocation in response to news about future technology can generate aggregate TFP fluctuations and, thus, trigger business cycles before the actual technological change is realized. Using the COMPUSTAT dataset, we find that the relative capital productivity of financially constrained to unconstrained firms is highly countercyclical. Moreover, our VAR analysis shows that news shocks can account for a substantial fraction of the relative capital productivity fluctuations over business cycle frequencies."

This paper studies this question using a heterogeneous-firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, where firms face fixed capital adjustment costs. Surprise increases in idiosyncratic risk lead firms to adopt a 'wait-and-see' policy for investment. The model is calibrated using a German firm-level data set with broader coverage than comparable U.S. data sets. The main result is that time-varying firm-level risk through 'wait-and-see' dynamics is unlikely a major source of business cycle fluctuations."

An enduring challenge that countries confront is the 'trilemma' of choices between three desirable, yet jointly unattainable objectives of maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime, unfettered cross-border capital flows and monetary policy independence. This study examines the extent of monetary autonomy for over 130 nations spanning the period 1999-2011. Using both pooled cross-sectional as well as time series analyses I find more loss of monetary sovereignty for fixed regimes than non-fixed ones, supporting the trilemma's predictions. However, I do note this difference is only marginal and several floaters exhibit 'fear of floating' behaviour allowing sufficient transmission of foreign interest rates. Finally, I examine the macroeconomic consequences of the three tenets of the trilemma. I find higher monetary independence, greater capital openness as well as greater regime flexibility to promote economic stability."

Vectorauto regression estimations show that feedback effects (the widely accepted explanation to asymmetry in volatility) exist between asymmetric shocks and volatility that ensues for both countries. The bidirectional Granger Causal relationships between exchange rate changes and the volatility that ensues together with the estimated impulse response functions offer further insight on how both countries 'exchange rate markets asymmetrically respond to shocks of either sign."

Verification is deployed by performing experiments in developed markets (e.g., the US stock market), emerging markets (e.g., the South Korean stock market) and global investments. A preselection procedure dealing with large datasets is also introduced to eliminate stocks that have low diversification potential before running the portfolio optimisation model. Portfolios are evaluated by four performance indices, i.e., the Sortino ratio, the Sharpe ratio, the Stutzer performance index, and the Omega measure. Experimental results demonstrate that high performance and also well-diversified portfolios are obtained if modified value-at-risk, variance, or semi-variance is concerned whereas emphasising only skewness, kurtosis or higher moments in general produces low performance and poorly diversified portfolios. In addition, the preselection applied to large datasets results in portfolios that have not only high performance but also high diversification degree."

Early realizations of a high-borrowing-ability regime turn agents optimistic about the persistence probability of this regime. Conversely, the first realization of a low-borrowing-ability regime turns agents unduly pessimistic. The model predicts large increases in household debt, land prices and excess returns during 1998-2006 followed by a collapse."

Variation in risk arises because households face fixed costs of transferring cash across financial accounts, implying that some households rebalance their portfolios infrequently. Accordingly, prices for risky assets respond sharply to aggregate shocks because only a relatively small subset of consumers are available to absorb these shocks. The model can account for both the mean and the volatility of returns on equity and the risk-free rate and generates a decline in the equity premium following an unanticipated easing of monetary policy."

Calibrating the model to a stylized version of the U.S. economy quantitatively illustrates these theoretical predictions.

211,"AB: A growing literature exploits credit score cutoff rules as a natural experiment to estimate the moral hazard effect of securitization on lender screening. However, these cutoff rules can be traced to underwriting guidelines for originators, not for securitizers. Moreover, loan-level data reveal that lenders change their screening at credit score cutoffs in the absence of changes in the probability of securitization. Credit score cutoff rules thus cannot be used to learn about the moral hazard effect of securitization on underwriting. By showing that this evidence has been misinterpreted, our analysis should move beliefs away from the conclusion that securitization led to lax screening."

This paper documents the impact of these two trends on the composition of school groups by ability and the importance of these composition effects for wages. The main finding is that there is a growing gap between the abilities of high school and college-educated workers that accounts for one-half of the college wage premium for recent cohorts and for the entire rise of the college wage premium between the 1910 and 1960 birth cohorts."

245,"AB: During the past fifty years, the US economy has seen a rapid decline in labor union membership and a substantial rise in wage inequality. Since labor unions compress wages between skilled and unskilled workers, a rising skill premium encourages skilled workers to withdraw from the union. If this withdrawal is accompanied by a fall in the productivity of unskilled workers, firms become reluctant to hire the relatively expensive union workers, reinforcing the decline in the unionization rate. Evaluating this hypothesis, we find that the rise in the skill premium explains about 40% of the decline in the unionization rate."

Each signal incorporates both public and private information: the correlation of a signal's realizations across the economy determines its publicity. If information sources differ in their publicity then price-formation and expectations-formation processes separate, causing output gaps to open. An output-stabilizing central bank prefers ""averagely public"" information, and sometimes limits the clarity of its policy announcements to achieve this. The bank's incentive to engage privately in costly information acquisition and transmission is strongest not for the most influential signals, but instead for those which drive the largest wedge between prices and expectations: signals that are far from averagely public."

Our earlier research found that easy monetary policy had a significant impact on energy prices during the period of 1980-2011. This paper finds that after the subprime mortgage crisis, the weaker exchange rate of the US dollar caused by the country's quantitative easing pushed oil prices in US dollars upward over the period of 2009-2012, by causing investors to invest in the oil market and other commodity markets while the world economy was in recession in this period. This trend had the effect of imposing a longer recovery time on the global economy, as oil has been shown to be one of the most important production inputs."

First, none of them make the effort to directly measure inflation expectations and include them in the inflation model specification. Second, they completely disregard potential asymmetric effects in the Croatian inflation-generating process. This paper adds to the literature in terms of both mentioned niches. Inflation expectations are obtained directly through the consumer surveys. The smooth transition regression (STR) is applied to inspect for possible non-linearities in the Croatian Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC). It is found that the pivotal role in the inflation-generating process can be assigned to expected inflation: as the inflation expectations increase, their effect on actual inflation significantly intensifies, while the impact of inflation persistence smoothly fades away. Inflation persistence is, however, also relevant, while the output gap parameters are not significant at all."

The result shows only unanticipated monetary policy can affect the stock return significantly. Based on anticipated effects, we examine whether monetary policy has asymmetric effects on the stock market by using a linear model with a dummy variable and a modified Markov-switching model respectively. Our empirical results support existing evidence for developed markets, suggesting that monetary policy has a significant impact on stock returns in bear-market periods, whereas the impact is weak and insignificant in bull-market periods. Given this, we surmise that investor sentiments and borrowing constraints are the main causes of the asymmetric effects found."

Real exchange rate misalignment is crucial to policy makers, as it determines the degree of policy intervention needed to correct deviation and achieve stability. In this paper, we use econometric techniques to compute the level of exchange rate misalignment and identify its determinants in Sudan, a country that suffers enormously from currency crisis. We probe further to assess the impact of real exchange rate misalignment on economic growth. Our vector error correction model results show that long-run movements in the real exchange rate can be explained by net foreign assets, productivity differentials, terms of trade shocks, and government expenditure. The Sudanese pound, with the exception of a few years, has been highly overvalued for the period 1980-2011, and the growth rate has been affected negatively and significantly by the real exchange rate misalignment."

The main results corroborate the theoretical notion that the Central Bank can smooth adjustments in effective short-term interest rates, as the latter affect expected short-term rates, thereby influencing long-term interest rates, which are fundamental for controlling output activity and price changes. Moreover, the MS-models show that these empirical relationships are more significant under a 'higher response regime'. In turn, the BVAR test yields impulse-response functions showing that shocks in expected rates have more persistent impacts on effective rates than the latter have on the former. Finally, the Cointegration and Vector Error Correction approaches are used as a robustness test and confirm the idea of a co-movement between expected and effective interest rates in Brazil. These results support the notion that Brazilian monetary policy is transparent, predictable and efficient."

An unrestricted VAR model is also used in order to analyse short-run dynamics and causality within these variables. The results report a long-run and significant relationship between these variables. In particular, the VAR model indicates that fluctuations in the KSE-100 index are significantly affected by the money supply and exchange rate but not the interest rate. Moreover, money supply has a positive relationship with the stock market and a negative relationship with interest rates and exchange rates. Interest rates have a weak and mixed relationship with all other variables. The dynamic relationships should aid policy-makers in understanding the effects of monetary policy changes."

More clearness emerges when more precise growth channels, and in particular, productivity dynamics is considered, with the estimated effects being positive and mainly strongly significant. All this points to an important conceptual insight suggesting that not any growth channel, but especially productivity-driven impulses are more intensively linked to financial aspects of economic development."

The approach links the observables to the model counterparts via a flexible specification which does not require the model-based component to be located solely at business cycle frequencies, allows the non-model-based component to take various time series patterns, and permits certain types of model misspecification. Applying standard data transformations induces biases in structural estimates and distortions in the policy conclusions. The proposed approach recovers important model-based features in selected experimental designs. Two widely discussed issues are used to illustrate its practical use."

I show that the divine coincidence holds only when inflation is stabilized at exactly zero. Even small deviations from zero generate policy trade-offs. I demonstrate this result using the model's non-linear equilibrium conditions to avoid biases from log-linearization. When the model is log-linearized, a non-zero steady state level of inflation gives rise to what I call the endogenous trend inflation cost-push shock in the New -Keynesian Phillips curve."

This paper uses an estimated New Keynesian model to analyze the role of policy risk in explaining business cycles. We directly measure risk from aggregate data and find a moderate amount of time-varying policy risk. The ""pure uncertainty"" effect of this policy risk is unlikely to play a major role in business cycle fluctuations. In the estimated model, output effects are relatively small because policy risk shocks are (i) too small and (ii) not sufficiently amplified."

If investments are sufficiently long-lived however then the cross-sectional distribution of capital holdings has virtually no bearing on the equilibrium and the aggregate behavior of fixed-cost models is essentially identical to neoclassical models. The findings are due to a near infinite elasticity of investment timing for long-lived investments--a feature shared by fixed-cost models and neoclassical models. ""Irrelevance results"" found in numerical studies of fixed-cost models are not parametric special cases but instead are fundamental properties of models with long-lived investment goods."

This finding supports sticky price models as an explanation for real exchange rate behavior, extending the classic argument of Mussa (1986) from a focus on short-run volatility to long-run dynamics.

Consider an endowment world economy model, where international financial markets are incomplete and contracts not enforceable. A union solves both frictions among member countries. We uncover conditions on initial incomes and net foreign assets of potential union members such that forming a union is welfare-improving over standing alone in the world economy. Consistently with evidence on economic integration, unions in our model occur (i) relatively infrequently, and (ii) emerge more likely among homogeneous countries, and (iii) rich countries."

In a competitive environment with free entry, these alternative systems are inherently fragile in the sense that they are subject to socially costly bank runs. These social costs are not internalized by private individuals and banks and may exceed their social benefits. We argue that as communication technologies improve, the social benefits of fractional reserve banking decrease, but the private benefits may still exceed the private costs so that such systems continue to be used. In such situations, 100% reserve requirements are optimal."

792,"AB: This paper traces career transitions of federal and state U.S. banking regulators from a large sample of publicly available curricula vitae, and provides basic facts on worker flows between the regulatory and private sector resulting from the revolving door. We find strong countercyclical net worker flows into regulatory jobs, driven largely by higher gross outflows into the private sector during booms. These worker flows are also driven by state-specific banking conditions as measured by local banks' profitability, asset quality and failure rates. The regulatory sector seems to experience a retention challenge over time, with shorter regulatory spells for workers, and especially those with higher education. Evidence from cross-state enforcement actions of regulators shows gross inflows into regulation and gross outflows from regulation are both higher during periods of intense enforcement, though gross outflows are significantly smaller in magnitude. These results appear inconsistent with a ""quid-pro-quo"" explanation of the revolving door, but consistent with a ""regulatory schooling"" hypothesis."

We find that when capital shortfalls are measured relative to risk-weighted assets, the ranking of financial institutions is not well correlated to the ranking of the V-Lab stress test, whereas rank correlations increase when required capitalization is a function of total assets. We show that the risk measures used in risk-weighted assets are cross-sectionally uncorrelated with market measures of risk, as they do not account for the ""risk that risk will change."" Furthermore, the banks that appeared to be best capitalized relative to risk-weighted assets were no better than the rest when the European economy deteriorated into the sovereign debt crisis in 2011."

862,"AB: Predatory trading may affect the incentives for banks to raise liquidity in times of financial distress. In these periods, borrowing becomes a signal of illiquidity, exposing borrowers to predatory trading and possible insolvency. A stigma of borrowing thus arises, leading distressed banks to take on more illiquid positions than they would otherwise. The Fed's Term Auction Facility (TAF) can alleviate this problem. The TAF's competitive auction format allows auction winners to signal that they are illiquid but relatively strong. The TAF may therefore be an effective policy tool during financial crises: by altering the signal value of borrowing, this facility supports the injection of liquidity into distressed banks. In normal times, however, this auction facility becomes counterproductive: by cream-skimming the relatively strong banks, the weakest banks are left as potential prey for predators. This suggests that the TAF is a policy best reserved for times of crisis."

We formalize this idea by adding an over-the-counter market with collateralized trades to the Mortensen-Pissarides model. An increase in public liquidity through a higher supply of real government bonds raises the real interest rate, crowding out private liquidity and increasing unemployment. If unemployment is inefficiently high, keeping liquidity scarce can be socially optimal. A liquidity crisis affecting the acceptability of private assets as collateral widens the rate-of-return difference between private and public liquidity, also increasing unemployment."

Creation of the syndicate and other actions were consistent with mitigating the moral hazard from such an intervention.

Balances not matched by a redemption right became fiat. This change also stabilized the value of bank money as a unit of account, freed the bank from defensive open market operations, and promoted seigniorage collection."

1035,"AB: Countries with greater inequality typically exhibit less support for redistribution and greater acceptance of inequality (e.g., U.S. versus Western Europe). If individual nations evolve along this pattern, a vicious cycle could form with reduced social concern amplifying primal increases in inequality. Exploring movements around these long-term levels, however, this study finds mixed evidence regarding the vicious cycle hypothesis. Larger compensation differentials are accepted as inequality grows. Weighing against this, growth in inequality is met with greater support for government-led redistribution. Inequality shocks can be reinforced in the labor market but do not result in weaker political preferences for redistribution."

I find that the stationary equilibrium replicates fairly well the distribution of leverage as well as the relationship between leverage, size and profitability. The counterfactual experiment points out relatively small effects of tax benefits on corporate capital structure. It also implies that the effects of the default cost on macroeconomic variables are almost negligible under endogenous capital structure choice."

Second, price changes within firms are substantially synchronized, which plays a dominant role in explaining pricing dynamics.

Nominal rigidities, combined with permanent productivity shocks, increase expected excess returns on production claims. This is mainly explained by consumption dynamics driven by rigidity-induced changes in employment and markups. An interest-rate monetary policy rule affects asset returns. Stronger (weaker) rule responses to inflation (output) increase expected excess returns. Policy shocks substantially increase asset-return volatility. Price rigidity heterogeneity produces cross-sectoral differences in expected returns. The model matches important macroeconomic moments and the Sharpe ratio of stock returns, but only captures a small fraction of the observed equity premium."

At the level of individual goods and services, the average contribution of these wages is significantly reduced, reflecting that good-specific sources of price dispersion, such as trade costs and good-specific markups, tend to average out across goods.

We show that, in a crisis that pushes the nominal interest rate to its lower bound, these reforms do not support economic activity in the short run, and may well be contractionary. In the absence of the appropriate monetary stimulus, reforms fuel expectations of prolonged deflation, increase the real interest rate, and depress aggregate demand. Our findings carry important implications for the current debate on the timing and the design of structural reforms in Europe."

1287,"AB: We show that some recent sovereign debt restructurings were characterized by (i) the absence of missed debt payments prior to the restructurings, (ii) reductions in the government's debt burden, and (iii) increases in the market value of debt claims for holders of the restructured debt. Since both the government and its creditors are likely to benefit from such restructurings, we label these episodes as ""voluntary"" debt exchanges. We present a model in which voluntary debt exchanges can occur in equilibrium when the debt level takes values above the one that maximizes the market value of debt claims. In contrast to previous studies on debt overhang, in our model opportunities for voluntary exchanges arise because a debt reduction implies a decline of the sovereign default risk. This is observed in the absence of any effect of debt reductions on future output levels. Although voluntary exchanges are Pareto improving at the time of the restructuring, we show that eliminating the possibility of conducting voluntary exchanges may improve welfare from an ex ante perspective. Thus, our results highlight a cost of initiatives that facilitate debt restructurings."

1318,"AB: Sovereign risk premia in several euro area countries have risen markedly since 2008, driving up credit spreads in the private sector as well. We propose a New Keynesian model of a two-region monetary union that accounts for this ""sovereign risk channel."" The model is calibrated to the euro area as of mid-2012. We show that a combination of sovereign risk in one region and strongly procyclical fiscal policy at the aggregate level exacerbates the risk of belief-driven deflationary downturns. The model provides an argument in favor of coordinated, asymmetric fiscal stances as a way to prevent self-fulfilling debt crises."

1386,"AB: In 2007, countries in the euro zone periphery were enjoying stable growth, low deficits, and low spreads. Then the financial crisis erupted and pushed them into deep recessions, raising their deficits and debt levels. By 2010, they were facing severe debt problems. Spreads increased and, surprisingly, so did the share of the debt held by domestic creditors. Credit was reallocated from the private sector to the public sector, reducing investment and deepening the recessions even further. To account for these facts, we propose a simple model of sovereign risk in which debt can be traded in secondary markets. The model has two key ingredients: creditor discrimination and crowding-out effects. Creditor discrimination arises because, in turbulent times, sovereign debt offers a higher expected return to domestic creditors than to foreign ones. This provides incentives for domestic purchases of debt. Crowding-out effects arise because private borrowing is limited by financial frictions. This implies that domestic debt purchases displace productive investment. The model shows that these purchases reduce growth and welfare, and may lead to self-fulfilling crises. It also shows how crowding-out effects can be transmitted to other countries in the euro zone, and how they may be addressed by policies at the European level."

These outcomes emerged from how the U.S. federal government financed three wars: the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. In the beginning, the U.S. government discriminated greatly in the returns it paid to different classes of creditors, but that pattern of discrimination diminished over time in ways that eventually rehabilitated the reputation of federal paper money as a store of value."

Long-run inflation (deflation) is optimal when the benefit of variety to consumers falls short of (exceeds) the market incentive for creating that variety--the desired markup, price indexation exacerbates this mechanism. Plausible preference specifications and parameter values justify positive long-run inflation rates. However, short-run price stability (around this non-zero trend) is close to optimal, even in the presence of endogenously time-varying desired markups that distort the intertemporal allocation of resources."

I show how, in an open economy, this endogenous financial deepening may reduce aggregate foreign assets in response to a rise in individual income risk, against the precautionary savings intuition. Conditions for this depend on whether default constrains complete or uncontingent contracts. The post-1980 rise in US household income risk strongly reduces foreign assets when domestic markets are complete or world interest rates low."

1574,"AB: Energy price shocks pose sudden challenges to economies. This paper examines how oil price shocks have influenced the U.S. economy over the last decades and especially focuses on the productivity slowdown in the years following an oil price shock. We extend the existing literature by considering medium-term business cycles, which consist of high-frequency components (""conventional"" business cycles, up to eight years) and medium-frequency components (8-50 years). We find that the medium-frequency consequences of energy price shocks are considerable and explain a significant part of the productivity slowdown."

Using a comprehensive sample from capital IQ (CIQ), we find that firms that are more likely to violate a covenant or incur higher costs from a covenant violation use less bank debt. Our results persist for both bank drawn revolving lines and term loans and for firms with or without access to the public bond market. These findings provide strong support to the survey results of Graham and Harvey (2001) that financial flexibility is an important factor in shaping corporate debt policy."

Changes in inflation, unemployment, output gap and policy interest rate behaviours during the last Great Recession that hit the US and Japanese economies are considered. According to a vector autoregression and VEC analyses, we found that even if there is evidence that inflation and unemployment are I (1), there is not a long-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff for the USA. Surprisingly, a short-run inflation-unemployment trade-off is very weak in Japan. This study is consistent with the opinion that the relationship between these two variables is not stable in either the short run nor in the long run: unemployment shows Granger causality with inflation but the opposite is not true in the USA. There is no Granger causality for Japan. We also find evidence that monetary policy lost its power in the US and Japanese real economies after the 2008 crisis."

1642,"AB: This paper develops a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model capable of evaluating the effect of large purchases of treasuries by central banks. The model exhibits imperfect asset substitutability between government bonds of different maturities and a feedback from the term structure to the macroeconomy. Both features are generated through the introduction of portfolio adjustment frictions. As a result, the model is able to isolate the portfolio rebalancing channel of quantitative easing (QE). This theoretical framework is employed to evaluate the impact on bond yields and on the macroeconomy of the large purchases of medium- and long-term treasuries recently carried out in the USA and UK. The results from the calibrated model suggest that large asset purchases of government assets had stimulating effects in terms of lower long-term yields, and higher output and inflation. The size of the effects is nevertheless sensitive to the speed of the exit strategy chosen by monetary authorities."

Though the short-term wealth effects of M&As have been extensively explored in the last decades, the long-term share price and operating performance is relatively under-researched. The current study attempts to investigate the post-event share price behaviour of a sample of acquiring firms involved in cross-border bank mergers. Using financial ratios, we also probe into the long-term operating performance of acquiring firms up to five years following the acquisition. The results show that acquiring firms experience a gradual positive price reversal up to two years subsequent to mergers. In addition, the financial performance seems to be improved in parallel to the market value. We conclude that cross-border bank mergers seem partially to benefit the acquiring firms in the long-term when synergistic gains from consolidation come to reality."

However an emerging body of evidence identifies ""investment shocks"" as important drivers of business cycles. This paper shows that a neoclassical model consistent with observed heterogeneity in labor supply and consumption across employed and non-employed can generate co-movement in response non-TFP shocks. Estimation reveals fluctuations in the marginal efficiency of investment that explain the bulk of business-cycle variance in consumption, investment and hours. A corollary of the model's empirical success is the labor wedge that is not important at business-cycle frequencies."

We show that when these costs are calibrated to match the observed infrequency of households' trading, the model is able to generate patterns of portfolio stock allocation over age and wealth that are constant or moderately increasing, thus more in line with the existing empirical evidence."

We address this contradiction using data moments of consumption and asset returns to fit a canonical international consumption risk sharing framework. Introducing persistent consumption risk, we find that its correlation across countries is more important for risk sharing than that of transitory risk. To identify these risk components, we jointly exploit the comovement of equity returns and consumption. This identification implies high correlations in persistent consumption risk, suggesting a strong degree of existing risk sharing despite low consumption correlations in the data."

Furthermore, optimal unemployment benefits react non-monotonically to a productivity shock: in response to a fall in productivity, they rise on impact but then fall significantly below their pre-recession level during the recovery. As compared to the current US unemployment insurance policy, the optimal state-contingent unemployment benefits smooth cyclical fluctuations in unemployment and deliver substantial welfare gains."

The analysis is conducted for both 5- and 10-year debts for the period from 15 May, 2012 until 23 April, 2014. An innovative aspect of the study lies in the use of 'Eurointelligence' newsflash to construct our news data. Our empirical analysis produces a number of novel results that support the evidence that news is an important driver for sovereign yield spreads. We specifically find that more news regarding the country-specific crisis raises the yield spreads. Moreover, we find that higher news in one selected country implies an increase in the yield spreads of other countries. Regarding volatility of debt market, it seems to be in most cases of analysis uncorrelated to news. Interesting implications emerge from this paper namely for the asset pricing and risk management."

173,"AB: This paper explains the lack of general consensus in previous studies on the direction of information flow between stocks and derivatives markets. We assume that informed traders do not develop absolute preference for one market, rather they react to private information as case by case. We provide theoretical and empirical proofs to validate this hypothesis. While deciding where trading, informed traders are attracted by higher liquidity and less transactions costs in spot market, and leverage effect offered by options market. We find that the use of leverage effect, which can largely compensate transactions costs and liquidity lack, depends on exceeding critical value of confidence in anticipation expressed as function of option value elasticity with respect to the underlying asset's price. We conclude that information flow between the stock and option markets depends on informed traders' confidence in anticipation based on private information quality and informed traders psychologies and abilities."

Our empirical analysis, conducted on a sample of 34 economies (13 IT and 21 non-IT economies) for the period from 1990 to 2010, show that on average IT adoption has had a significant effect in reducing the primary deficit in emerging countries that have adopted this monetary policy framework."

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes, using the EVT, an extension of the Kaplanski's (2004b) CAPM average-CVaR based both on the downside risk and the impact of rare events on the stock return distribution. Using French data, the estimated value of the extreme beta provides a suitable measure of the risk in crisis periods, but overestimates it otherwise."

The analysis involves the monthly returns of nine European companies operating in the automotive industry from January 2003 to April 2012 using 15 macroeconomic variables and the market index represented by S&P 350. The study finds that the S&P 350 positively affects stock returns, supporting the single index model. Furthermore, exchange rate, exports and platinum positively affect stock return, while aluminium and unemployment rate negatively affect stock return. The results suggest that a multi-index model using selected macroeconomics variables provides additional power in explaining the variability of the European stock returns in the automobile industry over a single index model using the market index alone."

Thus, the relationship between residual government ownership and performance is found convex, after privatisation. Such result implies that the control of the State confers benefits in the privatised companies. Managerial ownership is however negatively related to firm performance. So, we can assume that such structure of ownership is associated to an entrenchment effect rather than an incentive one after privatisation. Employee ownership is also negatively and significantly related to economic performance. Concerning, concentrated ownership we have detect no significant effect on performance. Finally, institutional ownership is found to be significantly and positively related to firm performance. Consequently, our results support the majority of the findings generated by the cognitive theory of governance as well as the disciplinary one."

This paper shows that introducing heterogeneity in price stickiness in the models overcomes these criticisms directed at them. The incorporation of heterogeneity in price stickiness reduces the need for large price shocks. With smaller price shocks, the new model comes close to matching the data on reset inflation."

With public information, households with low vacancy hazard rates pay lower rents and search in thicker rental markets. With private information, rentals are under-provided to long-duration households to discourage short-duration households from searching there. Ownership is attractive in part because it cures the private information problem. Using a novel data set of rental listings, we show that homeownership rates are high where rent-to-price ratios are low but rentals are scarce and that long-duration households sort into scarce rental markets. These patterns are consistent with the model only under private information."

440,"AB: A life-cycle model is developed in which households face income and house-price risk and buy houses with mortgages. This model, which accounts for key features in U.S. data, is used as a laboratory for prudential policy. Recourse mortgages increase the cost of default but also lower equity and increase payments. The effect on default is nonmonotonic. Loan-to-value (LTV) limits increase equity and lower the default rate, with negligible effects on housing demand. Combining recourse mortgages and LTV limits reduces the default rate while boosting housing demand. Together, they also prevent spikes in default after large declines in aggregate house prices."

Agents have rational expectations about financial crises as rare events, the probability the central bank purchases assets, and the exit strategy. Selling off assets quickly produces a double-dip recession while slowly unwinding generates a smooth recovery. Expectations about the exit strategy influence the initial effectiveness of purchases. Increasing the probability of purchases during crises distorts the pre-crisis economy and depends upon the exit strategy. The welfare benefits of unconventional policy may differ ex-ante versus ex-post, as can the preferred exit strategy."

492,AB: A familiar result in the canonical Dynamic New Keynesian (DNK) model is that policymakers constrained by the zero bound can improve outcomes by promising to keep rates low after the zero bound is not binding. We examine a general class of interest rate pegs in a variety of DNK models. Standard versions of the model produce counterintuitive reversals where the effect of the interest rate peg can switch from highly expansionary to highly contractionary for modest changes in the length of the interest rate peg. This unusual behavior does not arise in sticky information models of the Phillips curve.

The aggregate economy in the model still follows the Kaldor facts, but the composition of the underlying industries changes endogenously over time. Each industry exhibits a hump-shaped life cycle: as capital reaches a certain threshold level, a new industry appears, prospers, and then declines, to be gradually replaced by a more capital-intensive industry, ad infinitum. Analytical solutions are obtained to characterize the life cycle of each industry and the perpetual structural change."

Inventories provide additional information relative to aggregate investment regarding firms' intertemporal decisions, and thus additional insight in explaining business cycles. We show that variations in the discount factor estimated using inventories, which may be interpreted as fluctuations in a generalized investment wedge, play a key role in explaining the shifts in U.S. business cycles observed after the mid-1980s. Moreover, these variations correlate well with independent measures of credit market frictions."

During the boom, inflows from real estate investors tripled, far outpacing other segments such as first-time homebuyers. During the bust, a collapse in inflows keyed the debt decline, while an expansion of outflows due to defaults played a more minor role. Inflow declines partly reflect a dramatic falloff in first-time homebuying, especially for low credit score individuals. Further analysis helps support the notion that the differential decline by credit score reflects markedly tightened credit supply."

We construct a stochastic growth multi-country model in which heterogeneous agents face the following restrictions on asset trade. First, the degree of US equity market participation is higher than that of the rest of the world. Second, a fraction of households in each country maintains a fixed share of equity in its portfolios. In our calibrated model, which matches the US net foreign asset position and the equity premium, the average US household loads up more aggregate risk than the average foreign household by investing in risky assets abroad and issuing risk-free assets. As a result, the US is compensated by a high risk premium and runs trade deficits even as a debtor country. The long-run average trade deficit in our model accounts for 50% of the observed US trade deficit."

The estimated credit limit volatility is larger than most estimates of income volatility and varies over the business cycle. Within a model, variable credit limits create a reason for households to hold both high interest debts and low interest savings at the same time. Using the estimated credit volatility, the model explains why around one third of American households engage in this credit card puzzle. The approach also offers an important new channel through which financial system uncertainty can affect household decisions."

First, the role of the participation margin appears robust to adjustments for spurious transitions induced by reporting error. Second, conventional stocks-based analyses are subject to a stock-flow fallacy, neglecting offsetting forces of worker flows on the participation rate. Third, increases in labor force attachment among the unemployed during recessions are a leading explanation for the role of the participation margin."

In a model with three imperfect markets--goods, labor, and credit--we find that credit and goods market imperfections are substitutable in raising volatility. Goods market frictions are unique in generating persistence. Two key mechanisms in the goods market generate large hump-shaped responses to productivity shocks: countercyclical goods market tightness and prices alter future profit flows and raise persistence, procyclical search effort of consumers and firms raises amplification. Goods market frictions are thus key in understanding labor market dynamics."

694,"AB: When private agents learn a new policy rule, an optimal simple Taylor rule for disinflation differs substantially from that under full information. The central bank can reduce target inflation without much difficulty, but adjusting reaction coefficients on lagged inflation and output is more costly. Temporarily explosive dynamics emerge when there is substantial disagreement between perceived and actual feedback parameters, making the transition highly volatile. The bank copes by choosing reaction coefficients close to the private sector's prior mode, thereby sacrificing long-term performance in exchange for achieving lower transitional volatility."

Earnings management is measured with special items and investment is measured with capital expenditure. Samples of this study are manufacture firms that are listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange 2008-2010. As a purposive sampling, the secondary data of 47 financial reports of firms are selected. The data are collected from financial reports and Indonesian Capital Market Directory. The result of a regression test is inconsistent with the hypothesis proposed that earnings management with special item does not affect a company's investment decision. This result indicates that manufacturing firms in the research period do not use classification shifting of earnings management. The control variables in this research are cash flow and investment value of previous year (t - 1) that affects investment decisions."

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and remuneration as moderated by the remuneration committee. Its sample size is 386 firms listed in Bursa Malaysia studied from 2007 to 2009. Findings from this study indicate a significant positive relationship between remuneration committees and remuneration, which suggests the effectiveness of the committees. Furthermore, evidence from this study shows that the board of directors has a significant negative influence on non-executives' remuneration. Our study suggests that the non-executive director has less power in remunerative decisions than the executive director, reducing his or her own remuneration. However, this study cannot find evidence of a relationship between the board of directors and executive remuneration."

The paper used quarterly data for Malawi to conduct empirical analysis of the impact of financial inclusion on monetary policy effectiveness. Using vector autoregression model (VAR), Granger causality tests, and basic trend analyses, the study revealed consistent trends and some causality between financial inclusion indicators and inflation: the indicator for monetary policy effectiveness. The results further showed that money supply had an inverse relationship with inflation contrary to economic theory. The findings suggest that this is because the accounting of monetary aggregates does not include the activities of those outside the banking system. With this in view, the study concludes that financial inclusion will enable monetary policy to extend its reach to the financially excluded and aid policy makers to make better predictions of movements in inflation using monetary statistics."

We first show that creditors' aggregate behaviour to withdraw their funds operates as a signal to the policy maker about banks' solvency. Then it is shown that the policy maker optimally helps only illiquid but solvent banks and the lending rates are strictly positive whenever LLR is utilised. The rates can be seen as 'conditionally punitive' in the sense that they take the highest level under the restriction that the solvent borrowers survive.

952,"AB: China's external policies, including capital controls, managed exchange rates, and sterilized interventions, constrain its monetary policy options for maintaining macroeconomic stability following external shocks. We study optimal monetary policy in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that incorporates these ""Chinese characteristics"". The model highlights a monetary policy tradeoff between domestic price stability and costly sterilization. The same DSGE framework allows us to evaluate the welfare implications of alternative liberalization policies. Capital account and exchange rate liberalization would have allowed the Chinese central bank to better stabilize the external shocks experienced during the global financial crisis."

970,"AB: How does a fall in house prices affect real activity? This paper presents a tractable business cycle model in which a decline in house prices reduces geographical mobility, creating distortions in the labor market. This happens because homeowners face declines in their home equity levels, which makes it more difficult to provide the downpayment required for a new mortgage loan. Therefore, unemployed homeowners more often turn down job offers that would require them to move. The model can account for joint cyclical patterns in housing and labor market aggregates, and predicts a breakdown of the Beveridge curve in 2009. Counterfactual experiments are used to quantify the macroeconomic importance of the mobility channel during the Great Recession."

In contrast, the real impact of bubbles held by ordinary savers is more muted."

The productivity and time endowment channels dominate in importance and the risks implied by them contribute significantly to income inequality and precautionary savings.

This debt market advantage also helps to explain the weak relationship between the real exchange rate and relative consumption. Our stylized model matches the key facts about the U.S. international portfolio, the U.S. real exchange rate, and explains nearly 50% of the observed variation in the valuation effects. We find that taxing bond market transactions increases the volatility of the exchange rate, capital flows and allocations. In contrast, taxing equity positions stabilizes the exchange rate and capital flows while having little impact on the allocation.

We study this question in an open economy model in which imported food has a larger weight in domestic consumption than abroad and international risk sharing can be imperfect. A key novelty is that the real exchange rate and the terms of trade can move in opposite directions in response to world food price shocks. This exacerbates the policy trade-off between stabilizing output prices vis a vis the real exchange rate, to an extent that depends on risk sharing and the price elasticity of exports. We characterize implications for dynamics, optimal monetary policy, and the relative performance of practical monetary rules. While CPI targeting and expected CPI targeting can dominate PPI targeting if international risk sharing is perfect, even seemingly mild departures from the latter make PPI targeting a winner."

We find very similar results for the 1990-1991 recession, but not for the 2001 recession, where only the former was associated with a reduction in loan supply. The findings support the credit constraints hypothesis and underscore the role of bank lending in explaining labor market activity."

1211,"AB: In a two-country Schumpeterian growth model, we study the incentives for basic research investments by governments in a globalized world. A country's basic research investments increase with the country's level of human capital and decline with its own market size. This may explain why some smaller countries invest so much in basic research. Compared with the optimal investments achievable when countries coordinate their basic research policies, a single country may over-invest in basic research. However, the total amount of decentralized basic research investments is always below the socially optimal investment level, which justifies policy coordination in this area."

Although not exhaustive, our list covers from extreme (conservative and populist) to moderate behaviours, such that it is flexible in relation to the degree of conservativeness, as well as in relation to monetary regimes. We also use the traditional axiomatic approach for utility representation in order to investigate which of those preferences admit numerical representation. Our main finding states that so called stabiliser central bank is the only that admits representation through utility. Nevertheless, we show that even preferences without utility representation may be useful as alternatives for studies which propose different types of central bank."

In this paper, we study the reasons behind bank customers holding wealth in the form of immediate liquidity. Using micro data on clients' portfolios of a Portuguese bank, we ask whether there is a relationship between bank's capital ratio and the proportion of wealth that clients allocate to demand deposits, which is a relatively unexplored topic in the literature. Special attention is also paid to the impact of investors' financial knowledge regarding portfolio decisions by looking at university education, professional group and age. Results indicate that when banks' capital ratio decreases, savers put a larger fraction of their investment into demand deposits, especially savers with greater risk aversion and knowledge. Finally, we find evidence that investors with a university education or belonging to professional groups with higher skills follow more sophisticated investment strategies."

The findings in the paper show that the mean causality between the two capital markets is insignificant whereas the variance causality is significant. This result implies that the effect of news transmission between the two markets has no significant impact on these markets, but there is significant evidence of volatility transmission between the two markets. This means that public information (or news) held by the market participants has insignificant impact on stock price change but unexpected shocks on either market have significant spillover effects. A policy implication of such finding is that to contain irregular surprise shocks on Saudi stock market it is required stronger surveillance on portfolio managers' speculative and manipulative behaviour."

The first is the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) used to analyse the short run effects of the exchange rate on the industrial production index and on the consumer and import price indexes. The second is the vector error correction model (VECM) used to examine the long-run dynamic effects of the exchange rate upon the same variables relying on Tunisian monthly data during the period from January 1993 to June 2011. Unlike several empirical studies, the exchange rate is found to be a potential source not only of production but also of inflation reduction in Tunisia. Indeed, the direct channel of the exchange rate seems to have a significant impact on production and inflation in the long-run, whereas the indirect one has no effect on the money supply."

Second, exchange exposure of Korean SMEs with lower R&D expenditure is more likely to be significantly estimated. Third, the degree of exchange exposure increases as export dependency per employee increases, which shows the situation that Korean SMEs are lack of exchange risk hedging although they highly depend on export."

This need for balance sheet support--a within-government transaction--is distinct from the need for fiscal backing of inflation policy that arises even in models where the central bank's balance sheet is merged with that of the rest of the government."

Otherwise, this note distinguishes between intertemporal insolvency, rule insolvency, and period insolvency.

To this end, we construct a model in which government debt plays a key role in exchange, and can bear a liquidity premium. If asset market constraints bind, then there need not be deflation under an indefinite zero interest rate policy (ZIRP). Further, ZIRP may not be optimal under these circumstances. A Taylor-rule central banker could be subject to a ZIRP trap and persistently undershoot target inflation. As well, a liquidity premium on government debt creates additional Taylor rule perils, because of a persistently low real interest rate. We make a case that this is the key policy predicament currently faced by many central banks in the world."

1477,"AB: We analyze a new class of equilibria that emerges when a central bank conducts monetary policy by setting an interest rate (as an arbitrary function of its available information) and letting the private sector set the quantity traded. These equilibria involve a run on the central bank's interest target, whereby money grows fast, private agents borrow as much as possible against the central bank, and the shadow interest rate is different from the policy target. We argue that these equilibria represent a particular danger when banks hold large excess reserves, such as is the case following periods of quantitative easing. Our analysis suggests that successfully managing the exit strategy requires additional tools beyond setting interest-rate targets and paying interest on reserves, in particular, freezing excess reserves or fiscal-policy intervention may be needed to fend off adverse expectations."

We show that announcements of unconventional monetary policy measures by the Federal Reserve between 2008.IV and 2012, as a part of macroeconomic stabilization, were associated with a sizable increase in returns and debt-to-GDP ratios and contributed to fiscal imbalances. We use the Federal Reserve's portfolio composition as a proxy for unconventional monetary policy measures and show that it is significantly related to future bond returns and fiscal balances."

9,"AB: Our simple model features agents heterogeneous in skill and risk aversion, incomplete financial markets, and redistributive taxation. In equilibrium, agents become entrepreneurs if their skill is sufficiently high or risk aversion sufficiently low. Under heavier taxation, entrepreneurs are more skilled and less risk-averse, on average. Through these selection effects, the tax rate is positively related to aggregate productivity and negatively related to the equity risk premium. Both income inequality and stock prices initially increase but eventually decrease with the tax rate. Investment risk, stock market participation, and skill heterogeneity all contribute to inequality. Cross-country empirical evidence supports the model's predictions."

40,"AB: In a production economy with trade in financial markets motivated by the desire to share labor-income risk and to speculate, we show that speculation increases volatility of asset returns and investment growth, increases the equity risk premium, and reduces welfare. Regulatory measures, such as constraints on stock positions, borrowing constraints, and the Tobin tax have similar effects on financial and macroeconomic variables. However, borrowing constraints and the Tobin tax are more successful than constraints on stock positions at improving welfare because they substantially reduce speculative trading without impairing excessively risk-sharing trades."

In our occupational choice model with heterogeneous wealth endowments, market failure due to unobservability of entrepreneurial talent endogenously creates a misalignment between surplus maximizing reforms and reforms that are preferred by the median voter, who is a worker. This is in contrast to the world without market failure where the electorate unanimously vote in favor of surplus maximizing institutional reforms. This paper illustrates how market failure could lead to political failure even in the benchmark political system that is free from capture by interest groups."

102,"AB: We show that an increase in banks' holdings of domestic Sovereign debt decreases the ability of domestic Sovereigns to successfully enact bailouts. When Sovereigns finance bailouts with newly issued debt and the price of Sovereign debt is sensitive to unanticipated debt issues, then bailouts dilute the value of banks' Sovereign debt holdings rendering bailouts less effective. We explore this feedback mechanism in a model of financial intermediation in which banks are subject to managerial moral hazard and ex ante optimality requires lenders to commit to ex post inefficient bank liquidations. A benevolent Sovereign may desire to enact bailouts to prevent such liquidations thereby neutralizing lenders' commitment. In this context, home bias for Sovereign debt may arise as a mechanism to deter bailouts and restore lenders' commitment."

164,"AB: We develop a new model of the mortgage market that emphasizes the role of the financial sector and the government. Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. Both borrowers and intermediaries can default. The government provides both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations and higher financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries' balance sheets. Foreclosure crises beget fiscal uncertainty, further disrupting the optimal allocation of risk in the economy. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee ""crowds in"" the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector and less fiscal uncertainty, consumption smoothing improves and foreclosure rates fall. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases, so does wealth inequality."

This paper investigates the macroeconomic repercussions of this change in policy, particularly for the distributions of income, wealth and consumption. Changes in taxes and transfers account for nearly half of the rise in wealth concentration. Nonetheless, their impact on the distributions of income and consumption has been minor due to changes in equilibrium prices and the offsetting effects of tax cuts and transfers on the dispersion of consumption. Results highlight the role of increasing wage dispersion during this period as the main driver of trends in inequality."

229,"AB: Calculating the welfare implications of changes to economic policy or shocks requires economists to decide on a normative criterion. One approach is to elicit the relevant moral criteria from real-world policy choices, converting a normative decision into a positive inference, as in the recent surge of ""inverse-optimum"" research. We find that capitalizing on the potential of this approach is not as straightforward as we might hope. We perform the inverse-optimum inference on U.S. tax policy from 1979 through 2010 and argue that the results either undermine the normative relevance of the approach or challenge conventional assumptions upon which economists routinely rely when performing welfare evaluations."

264,"AB: Fiscal multipliers appear to vary greatly over time and space. Based on VARs for a large number of countries, we document a strong correlation between wealth inequality and the magnitude of fiscal multipliers. In an attempt to account for this finding, we develop a life-cycle, overlapping-generations economy with uninsurable labor market risk. We calibrate our model to match key characteristics of a number of OECD economies, including the distribution of wages and wealth, social security, taxes, and government debt and study how a fiscal multiplier depends on various country characteristics. We find that the fiscal multiplier is highly sensitive to the fraction of the population who face binding credit constraints and also to the average wealth level in the economy. These findings together help us generate a cross-country pattern of multipliers that is quite similar to that in the data."

296,"AB: In this paper we compute the optimal tax and education policy transition in an economy where progressive taxes provide social insurance against idiosyncratic wage risk, but distort the education decision of households. Optimally chosen tertiary education subsidies mitigate these distortions. We highlight the quantitative importance of general equilibrium feedback effects from policies to relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers: subsidizing higher education increases the share of workers with a college degree thereby reducing the college wage premium which has important redistributive benefits. We also argue that a full characterization of the transition path is crucial for policy evaluation. We find that optimal education policies are always characterized by generous tuition subsidies, but the optimal degree of income tax progressivity depends crucially on whether transitional costs of policies are explicitly taken into account and how strongly the college premium responds to policy changes in general equilibrium."

First, it provides a new theory of wealth inequality that merges two empirically relevant forces generating inequality: bequest motives and inheritance of ability across generations, and an earnings process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest. Second, it uses the resulting calibrated framework to study the effects of changing estate taxation. Increasing the estate tax reduces the wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few and the economic advantage of being born to a rich and super-rich family at the cost of reduced aggregate capital and output. However, all of these effects are quite small. In contrast, increasing estate taxation can generate a significant welfare gain to a newborn under the veil of ignorance, but this comes at a large welfare cost for the super-rich."

389,AB: The dynamic impacts of the monetary policy's inertia behaviour have not been empirically investigated by the related literature. This work analyses such impacts for the Brazilian monetary policy's inertia or gradualism from January 2005 to May 2013. The Kalman filter was adopted to extract the inertia series based on a monetary policy rule selected from a sample of specifications and estimated models. The findings show that an increase in Brazil's monetary policy inertia is followed by positive output gaps that cause inflation and inflationary expectation deviations. These results suggest the need for better calibration of the policy's gradualism to improve the inflation-targeting regime's credibility.

We use a reduced form approach to measuring inflation persistence, modelling inflation as an autoregressive process. We measure persistence as the half-life of a shock to that process. Our analysis employs both a Frequentist approach and a Bayesian approach to identify breaks in inflation persistence. Both our Frequentist and Bayesian results indicate that inflation persistence has undergone significant changes over the past 60 years."

We utilise the approach of Perron and Qu (2010). The daily data span the period 3 January, 1990 to 13 June, 2013 for the stock market returns, and from 3 January, 1997 to 24 June, 2013 for the Forex rate returns. The analysis of the ACF, the periodogram and the fractional parameter estimates for both volatilities suggests that the theoretical predictions of the simple mixture model of Perron and Qu (2010) are correct. The results are more conclusive for the stock market volatility. The application of one statistic suggests rejection of the long-memory hypothesis for both volatilities. Other two statistics provide weak evidence against the null hypothesis, above all for the Forex rate market. To reinforce the findings, some results associated with other investigations are presented."

However, the empirical evidence is not unanimous. This paper investigates the relationship between liquidity and stock return in Vietnam by employing an updated dataset of market and financial data of listed companies in the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange ranging from 2007 to 2012. Our results suggest that the relationship between liquidity and stock returns is different in Vietnam stock market. In other words, we document a reliable positive relationship between liquidity measures and stock returns and negative relationship between illiquidity measures and stock returns. However, we do not find evidence in supporting the relation between risk associated with fluctuation in liquidity and stock returns."

As this puzzle has not been resolved, we explore it using an alternative portfolio choice problem that seeks to outperform the benchmark market index--FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI. This study makes a significant contribution by using an industry-common objective function and also incorporating floor/ceiling constraints and the effect of delisting. Using evolutionary algorithm, we construct optimal portfolios with varying Ns in-sample for out-of-sample analysis. We find that 1/N is superior with smaller Ns, although optimised portfolio dominates as N increases. However, with both diversification policies underperform the market and produce very low Sharpe ratios, their efficacies for practical applications are highly suspect."

This means that the CDS market functions as insurance in Spain but not elsewhere. The intensified sovereign crisis delivered a shock to the CDS and government bond markets, resulting in the loss of market integration and the price discovery function. No evidence is found that the CDS market intensified the degree of the crisis because a unilateral influence from the CDS market to the government bond market is not observed in any of the countries studied."

This trickles down the crisis effect to small nodes and whole system becomes fragile. We analysed selected EU members banking system network in terms of their pre- and post-crisis status. By using the matrix of bilateral obligations and their capital levels, conducted stress test simulations for both periods. Different levels of shocks entail most aspects of stress tests in terms of identifying networks strength and interconnectedness. Short-terms to long-term clearing scenarios are used to identify strong and weak nodes within system during both time frames. Default probabilities for different levels of shocks shows realistic picture of the banking systems, as they received huge bailouts and financing from governments and regulators. Default probabilities are used to identify the level of difficulty faced by particular institution or whole system."

In this paper, we investigate how the default contagion caused by a single bank's initial shock spread to its creditors and even the whole system, and how to estimate the contagion probability and contagion index, which reflects the impact on the rest of interbank system if one bank fails. By constructing the interbank network, we combine some parameters, such as net worth, leverage of outside assets and the network connectivity, to derive the explicit measures on the potential magnitude of interbank network effect on contagion with little detailed information. Results suggest that contagion effects are most significant if the originating bank is highly leveraged or has high network connectivity."

Therefore, creating a contestable market is more realistic than establishing perfect competition. This study aims to examine the role of opening the market to create contestability. In the last 30 years, the industry experienced structural changes from a closed-regulated into open-less regulated industry. The Panzar-Rosse method is employed to estimate the degree of competition, find the market structure and assess the impact of opening the market to competition. This study found that in a free entry market, banks are more competitive. The potential entrants act as market discipline so it facilitates the creation of a contestable market as observed in 1989. On the other hand, the absence of potential entrants explains the lack of market discipline for the incumbents to operate efficiently in the 2000s."

Economical and political dynamics, which simultaneously come up with globalisation process, have dramatically changed the scope and form of budgeting application. Gender responsive budgeting, one of these budgeting applications is a practice to provide equitable distribution of public burden and public spending between women and men. In this approach, the public budget is used to eliminate discriminations between women and men. Turkey has been adapting the idea of gender responsive budgeting since 1987. The gender responsive budgeting approach has been incorporated in the budgeting process in Turkey since 2008. This study examines the gender budgeting applications in Turkey so far, pictures the current situation, and identifies the steps to be taken for a successful application of gender responsive budgeting in Turkey."

The stock prices volatility is partly explained by volatility in exchange rates. We adopt an asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH) model which takes into account long memory behaviour, speed of market information, asymmetries and leverage effects. For BSE Sensex, NIFTY and JPY/INR there is an asymmetric response of volatilities to positive and negative shocks and negative correlation exists between returns and volatility and thus bad news will create greater volatility. However, for USD/INR, Euro/INR and GBP/INR good news has greater effect on price volatility than the bad news. The study results also suggest the presence long memory behaviour and persistent volatility clustering phenomenon amongst exchange rates and stock markets."

The VAR model estimations provide evidence that there is reciprocal performance influence between the majority of these stock markets. Finally, the Treynor ratios dependence on a group of macroeconomic variables (real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, inflation rate, long-term public debt interest rates and public budget deficit ratio) was estimated by panel data regression methods. According to the evidence provided by these estimations, the long-term interest rate is the macroeconomic variable that most clearly affects the performance differences between these domestic stock markets."

Monetary policy follows a Taylor rule and a change in the target is announced several periods in advance. I show that highly plausible parameter values may lead to short-run instability and that the conditions for the stability of learning are more demanding soon after the policy change is announced. Also, the farther in advance the change is announced the narrower is the range of policy parameters that generate stability. This is because with a long transition, any estimation error is projected farther into the future and its effects are therefore magnified. These results suggest that advance communication of a change in the inflation target may destabilise inflation in the short run, when the central bank changes its inflation target, a brief transition may be preferable."

The causality analyses suggest that only industrial production and foreign equity net inflow cause stock market liquidity.

The results show that stock prices have a positive impact, indicating that the wealth effect holds and the stock market leads the REIT market. Before the introduction of Abenomics, the positive impact of stock prices is larger. This is consistent with the fact that REIT was sometimes actively purchased when the stock market showed weakness after the introduction of Abenomics. The negative impact of interest rates indicates that an increase causes a decline in the REIT price. After the introduction of Abenomics, the negative impact of interest rates is larger for the maturity of 10 years. This is consistent with the fact that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB) aggressively to flatten the yield curves of both JGB and swap through quantitative and qualitative easing."

We study the transmission channels of monetary policy on the fluctuations of domestic output and inflation over the short and long run in open and closed economy settings. We find that domestic shocks have higher impact on monetary policy calibration and the dynamic of the internal demand. The inclusion of the working capital channel for a country like Tunisia exhibiting high level of indebtedness of local firms helps better describe the behaviour of macroeconomic variables in response to shocks emanating from the policy side. We show that the policy reaction parameters of the Central Bank confirm our hypothesis that the latter has been following closely the Taylor rule. This finding explains the recent inflation trend in the country."

The assessment of market structure and the level of competition in the financial sector are important for the exercise of the competition authority's power to enforce the national competition law. It helps the competition authority to better understand the nature of the financial services market such as the existence of market power and features that facilitate anti-competitive behaviour. This paper attempts to analyse structure of the market and the level of competition in the Malaysian financial market using two measures, namely concentration ratio (CR) and Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). The study shows that the banking sector can be considered as 'unconcentrated'. However, based on ownership (foreign or local) the study indicates such sector is 'moderately' concentrated. For the insurance sector, general insurance can be considered as 'unconcentrated', whereas life insurance is 'highly concentrated'."

The study uses the data of 8.104 observations, and is investigated using regression of panel data. The study found that assets, spread of interest rate and capital were the most significant factors influencing the financial sustainability of rural banking industry. Furthermore, a rural bank relying its funding on non-traditional deposits had a stronger financial sustainability. The study also found that, in terms of quality of loan and earning capacity, rural banks that are located in Sumatra region were better than two other regions. However, if the measurement uses a profitability indicator, Java region was better than other regions in the study."

The study employs generalised method of moments (GMM) estimators. The results of the post-IT adoption and full sample periods are characterised by forward-looking IT rule. Furthermore, the paper uses the augmented monetary policy rule to identify the factors that determine the monetary policy instrument for South Africa. The results confirm that the South African monetary economy practised full-fledged IT principle immediately after the adoption of the IT framework and the monetary policy rule serves as a nominal anchor for the economy. The policy implication is that for South Africa to continue keeping inflation to the required single-digit target, the Reserve Bank should further strengthen the IT framework adopted in the economy."

As borrower of first resort, government can issue bonds, siphoning off uninformed demand for risky corporate debt, reducing wasteful informed speculation. Government bonds eliminate pooling at high leverage or improve risk sharing in such equilibria. Optimal government bond supply is increasing in demand for safe assets and non-monotonic in marginal Q."

Without price commitment, time inconsistency is alleviated by interaction between the benevolent monetary authority and the politically distorted fiscal authority. With price commitment, nominal bonds will be used for wasteful spending by the politically distorted fiscal authority. Price commitment results in lower welfare because it eliminates monetary control over fiscal decisions."

A simple target criterion continues to provide a good approximation to optimal policy. Such a ""flexible inflation target"" can be implemented by a central-bank reaction function that is similar to a forward-looking Taylor rule, but adjusted for changes in current and expected future credit spreads."

We apply these generic results to the case of an uncertain probability of catastrophes, and to the case of an uncertain trend or volatility of growth. Adding some persistence to unobservable shocks into our benchmark model, we show that the term structure of risk premia is hump-shaped."

We formalize this intuition by estimating a dynamic model of firms' financing and savings decisions, and use our model along with firm level data to construct an empirical estimate of the average cost of external finance from 1980 to 2014."

Evidence presented here suggests that the NK model's implications for fiscal policy at the zero bound may not be all that different from its implications for policy away from it. For a range of empirically relevant parameterizations, employment increases when the labor tax rate is cut and the government purchase multiplier is less than 1.05."

The reputation building implies that when a committed central banker first takes office, he should resist the temptation to stimulate output with initially high but declining inflation, he should reverse a missed inflation target rather than accommodate it, and he should adopt a less accommodative inflation response to a cost-push shock than a full commitment solution suggests."

As job opportunities in middle-skill occupations disappeared, employment opportunities concentrated in the highest and lowest wage occupations. A two-country stochastic growth model that incorporates trade in tasks, rather than in goods, accounts for this evidence. This polarization did not result from a steady process: the relative employment share of each skill group significantly fluctuated over short to medium horizons. The aggregate shocks estimated within this framework can rationalize the observed skill-based employment dynamics, while providing a good fit to the macroeconomic data."

Incorporating a participation decision into a standard New Keynesian model with matching frictions, we show that market tightness becomes endogenously more volatile because both the opportunity cost of home production and the reservation wage vary with participation. The model can simultaneously explain the low volatility of participation, the high volatility of unemployment, and a procyclical workers' outside option of working. A policy of strict inflation targeting is close to optimal, and increasing the response of the interest rate to inflation does not have a large impact on the volatility of unemployment because of the endogenous response of participation."

This paper provides a simple identifying restriction, based on inventory dynamics, that tightly pins down this contribution. Structural models predict that finished-good inventories should fall when there is an increase in consumption and investment induced by news shocks. A structural VAR with these sign restrictions indicates that news shocks account for at most 20 percent of output volatility. Since inventories comove positively with consumption and investment in the data, shocks that generate negative comovement cannot account for the bulk of fluctuations."

1239,AB: How effective is a more progressive tax scheme in raising revenues? We answer this question in a life-cycle economy with heterogeneity across households and endogenous labor supply. Our findings show that a tilt of the U.S. income tax schedule towards high earners leads to small increases in revenue. Maximal revenue in the long run is only 6.8% higher than in our benchmark--about 0.8% of initial GDP--while revenues from all sources increase by just about 0.6%. Our conclusions are that policy recommendations of this sort are misguided if the aim is to exclusively raise government revenue.

We use a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents to consider the effects of temporary homebuyer tax credits and the asymmetric tax treatment of owner-occupied and rental housing on prices, quantities, allocations, and welfare. The model suggests that homebuyer tax credits temporarily raise house prices and transaction volumes, but have negative effects on welfare. Removing the asymmetric tax treatment of owner-occupied and rental housing can generate welfare gains for a majority of agents across steady states, but welfare impacts are substantially more varied along the transitions between steady states."

At the outbreak of a financial crisis, however, governments are usually uncertain about its systemic nature, and may delay intervention to learn more from endogenous market outcomes. We show such delay introduces strategic restraint: banks restrict their portfolio riskiness relative to their peers to avoid being the worst performers and bearing the costs of delay. Hence, uncertainty has the potential to self-discipline banks and mitigate crises in the absence of commitment. We study the effects of standard regulations on these novel forces."

This paper studies a random matching search model with human capital losses during unemployment. Wage dispersion increases, as workers accept lower wages to avoid long unemployment spells. The model explains between a third and half of the observed residual wage dispersion. When adding on-the-job search, the model accounts for all of the residual wage dispersion and generates substantial dispersion even for high values of non-market time. The paper thus addresses the trade-off between explaining frictional wage dispersion and the cyclical behavior of unemployment."

We find that the monthly frequency of nominal wage changes is 13 percent. Although nominal wage cuts are rare, their frequency rises following a large macroeconomic shock. Timing of wage changes is both time-dependent and state-dependent: we find evidence of synchronization of adjustment and contracts of fixed duration, but also that inflation and unemployment over the wage spell affect the timing of adjustment."

Using a new empirical measure of uncertainty based on the Michigan survey and a VAR model, we show that these theoretical patterns are consistent with US data.

An intrinsically useless asset has a positive value and raises welfare because it helps investors with idiosyncratic productivity to obtain more credit in imperfect financial markets. However, the bubbly equilibrium is only the second best. Moreover, bubbles may burst, and this leads to recessions. The model's analytical solution allows for the study of many policies. We find that a policy of purchasing the asset avoids financial crises but nevertheless results in the second-best outcome. A policy that taxes depositors and subsidizes investors both prevents crashes and achieves the first-best outcome."

1529,"AB: The Great Inflation of the 1970s can be understood as the result of equilibrium indeterminacy in which loose monetary policy engendered excess volatility in macroeconomic aggregates and prices. The Federal Reserve inadvertently pursued policies that were not anti-inflationary enough because it did not fully understand the economic environment it was operating in. Specifically, it had imperfect knowledge about the structure of the economy and was subject to data misperceptions. The combination of learning about the economy and the use of mis-measured data resulted in policies, which the Federal Reserve believed to be optimal, but when implemented led to equilibrium indeterminacy."

To this aim, we propose a new index measuring the coordination effects of policy communication on private agents' expectations. This index is based on the disagreement amongst US professional forecasters about future government spending. The underlying intuition is that a clear fiscal policy communication can coalesce expectations, reducing disagreement. Results indicate that, in times of low disagreement, the output response to fiscal spending innovations is positive and large, mainly due to private investment response. Conversely, periods of elevated disagreement are characterised by muted output response."

Bonds matter: in equilibrium, investors structure their bond portfolio to hedge real exchange rate risks. Equity home bias arises when non-financial income risk is negatively correlated with equity returns, after controlling for bond returns. Our framework allows us to derive equilibrium bond and equity portfolios in terms of directly measurable hedge ratios. An empirical application to G-7 countries finds strong empirical support for the theory. We are able to account for a significant share of the equity home bias and obtain an aggregate currency exposure of bond portfolios comparable to the data."

However, our evidence shows that portfolios with higher risk exposure do not earn higher returns. More importantly, our evidence shows a striking two-regime pattern for all 10 macro-related factors: high-risk portfolios earn significantly higher returns than low-risk portfolios following low-sentiment periods, whereas the exact opposite occurs following high-sentiment periods. These findings are consistent with a setting in which market-wide sentiment is combined with short-sale impediments and sentiment-driven investors undermine the traditional risk-return tradeoff, especially during high-sentiment periods."

Differences in occupation-specific flexibility, disciplined with the observed patterns in hours (level, persistence, dispersion) and income (persistence, dispersion), can explain relatively low income levels of entrepreneurs in the US and the occupation-specific distributions of working hours and income. Policy relevance of the model features is discussed using experiments of workweek restrictions and income taxation."

Consistent with the transmission of private information, these effects are concentrated in low-documentation loans and for issuers that were highly dependent on the GSEs and were corporate affiliates of the mortgage originators. Additional analysis of yield spreads shows that these performance differences were not reflected in prices."

If (1) Ricardian Equivalence holds, and (2) households do not borrow without risk while holding positive gross positions in other riskless assets, the crowding-out coefficient equals the fraction of the aggregate tax cut that accrues to households that borrow. In the conventional case in which all households receive equal tax cuts, the crowding-out coefficient equals the fraction of households that borrow, in the United States, about 75% of households borrow, so the crowding-out coefficient is predicted to be 0.75. Allowing for cross-sectional variation in tax changes increases the crowding-out coefficient to about 0.85."

Because of this new nexus between stock and bond markets, a parsimonious three-factor dynamic no-arbitrage model can be used to jointly price book-to-market-sorted portfolios of stocks and maturity-sorted bond portfolios, while reproducing the time-series variation in expected bond returns.

Whereas in the early 1980s most of global investment was funded by household saving, nowadays nearly two-thirds of global investment is funded by corporate saving. This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment, implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the determination of the flow of funds across sectors. Changes, including declines in the real interest rate, the price of investment, and corporate income taxes generate increases in corporate profits and shifts in the supply of sectoral saving that are of similar magnitude to those observed in the data."

248,"AB: The financial intermediation sector is important and not only for channeling resources from agents in excess of funds to agents in need of funds (lending channel). By issuing liabilities it also creates financial assets held by other sectors of the economy for insurance or liquidity purpose. When the intermediation sector creates less liabilities or their value falls, agents are less willing to engage in activities that are individually risky but desirable in aggregate (bank liabilities channel). The paper shows how financial crises driven by self-fulfilling expectations about the liquidity of the banking sector are transmitted to the real sector of the economy. Since the government could also create financial assets by borrowing, the paper analyzes how public debt affects the issuance of liabilities by the financial intermediation sector."

279,"AB: Optimal regulatory restrictions on banks have to solve a delicate balance. Tighter regulations reduce the likelihood of banks' distress. Looser regulations foster the allocation of funds toward productive investments. With multiple banks, optimal regulation becomes even more challenging. Banks form partnerships in the interbank lending market in order to face liquidity needs and to meet investment possibilities. We show that the interbank network can suddenly collapse when regulations are pushed beyond a critical level, with a discontinuous increase in systemic risk as the cross-insurance of banks collapses."

310,"AB: Open-end mutual funds face investor redemptions, but the sale of the underlying assets depends on asset managers' portfolio decisions. If asset managers use cash holdings as a buffer to meet redemptions, they can mitigate fire sales of the assets. If they hoard cash in response to redemptions, they will amplify fire sales. We present a global game model of investor runs and identify conditions under which asset managers hoard cash. In an empirical investigation of bond mutual funds, we find that cash hoarding is the rule rather than the exception and that less liquid bond funds display stronger cash hoarding."

Using a unique dataset of dealer-bond-level transactions, we link changes in liquidity of individual U.S. corporate bonds to dealers' transaction activity and balance sheet constraints. We show that, prior to the financial crisis, bonds traded by more levered institutions and institutions with investment bank like characteristics were more liquid, but this relationship reverses after the financial crisis. In addition, institutions that face more regulations after the crisis both reduce their overall volume of trade and have less ability to intermediate customer trades."

To do so, we know that business cycle synchronisation is a good tool to test for the possible success of a monetary union. The empirical results for the GCC countries are close to those for the OECD and European Union countries, especially for the case of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Thus, the economic and financial indicators are positive, implying that the GCC countries are ready for the creation of a monetary union, but political decisions will be more effective in reducing the barriers to the creation of this union."

The evolution of the unmanaged to managed short-term interest rate as a monetary policy tool demonstrates a continuing correcting process of a biased sensitivity towards output growth in the gold standard era to a more balanced emphasis on price stability and output growth in the modern-Fed period. Evidence of this study suggests that the monetary policy with a more balanced emphasis on inflation and output can enhance the policy effectiveness measured by a simple assessment ratio which links GDP gap and standard deviation of inflation together so that the ratio can directly quantify the Fed's two top policy goals, promoting sustainable output growth and lowering price volatility."

660,"AB: Have bank regulatory policies and unconventional monetary policies--and any possible interactions--been a factor behind the recent ""deglobalisation"" in cross-border bank lending? To test this hypothesis, we use bank-level data from the UK--a country at the heart of the global financial system. Our results suggest that increases in microprudential capital requirements tend to reduce international bank lending and some forms of unconventional monetary policy can amplify this effect. Specifically, the UK's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) significantly amplified the effects of increased capital requirements on cross-border lending. Quantitative easing did not appear to have a similar effect and countries with stronger prudential capital regulations were partially insulated against the effects of these changes in UK policy. We find that this interaction between microprudential regulations and the FLS can explain roughly 30% of the contraction in aggregate UK cross-border bank lending between mid-2012 and end-2013, corresponding to around 10% of the global contraction in cross-border lending. This suggests that unconventional monetary policy designed to support domestic lending can have the unintended consequence of reducing foreign lending."

Financial institutions allocate capital endogenously across countries, determining the cost of capital to firms and the wealth of nations. The cost of financial disintegration is reduced access to capital for firms which results in lower output. Financial disintegration leads to a 0.54% fall in output in Europe since the crisis.

Slow adjustment in the shipping sector generates boom-bust cycles in freight rates and, as a consequence, in currency risk premia. We validate these predictions using global shipping data. Our calibrated model explains about 57% of the narrowing of interest rate differentials post-crisis."

The evidence also shows a rebalancing from bank loans towards bonds. To study these developments, we develop a dynamic open economy model where these modes of finance are determined endogenously. The model replicates the stylized facts following a drop in world interest rates, in particular, rebalancing towards bonds occurs because bank credit becomes relatively more expensive, reflecting the scarcity of bank equity. More generally, the model is suitable for studying interactions between modes of finance and the macroeconomy."

This paper introduces a method of quantifying the uncertainty associated with round responses in pre-existing survey data. I construct micro-level and time series measures of inflation uncertainty since 1978. Inflation uncertainty is countercyclical and correlated with inflation disagreement, volatility, and the Economic Policy Uncertainty index. Inflation uncertainty is lowest among high-income consumers, college graduates, males, and stock market investors. More uncertain consumers are more reluctant to spend on durables, cars, and homes. Round responses are common on many surveys, suggesting numerous applications of this method."

The estimated model shows that, as collateral constraints became slack during the housing boom of 2001-2006, expanding housing wealth made a small contribution to consumption growth. By contrast, the housing collapse that followed tightened the constraints and sharply exacerbated the recession of 2007-2009. The empirical relevance of this asymmetry is corroborated by evidence from state- and MSA-level data."

Uncertainty over the insurance payout when the debt is renegotiated explains why in the data, as the output declines, the CDS spread becomes lower than the bond spread. Finally, my results show that the 2012 CDS naked ban, that decreased the levels of CDS for European countries, is a welfare reducing policy."

While temporary sales account for 95% of price change in our data, retail prices respond to a wholesale cost increase entirely through the regular price. Sales actually respond temporarily in the opposite direction from regular prices, as though to conceal the price hike. Additional evidence from responses to commodity cost and local unemployment shocks, as well as broader evidence from BLS data, reinforces these findings. Institutional evidence indicates that sales are complex contingent contracts, determined substantially in advance. In a standard price-discrimination model, these institutional practices leave little money ""on the table""."

The model comprises two productive sectors: in one sector, firms can finance investments through a bond market. In the other, firms rely on bank credit. Financial frictions limit banks' borrowing capacity. Aggregate shocks impact firms' productivity. From a welfare perspective, banks lend too much in high productivity states and too little in bad states, although financial markets are complete. Imposing a (stricter) capital requirement in good states corrects capital misallocation, increases expected output and social welfare. Even with risk-neutral agents, stabilization of credit cycles is socially beneficial."

The model unemployment insurance program includes four realistic features: 1) a 50% replacement rate up to a benefit cap, 2) finite duration of eligibility during a jobless spell, 3) limited eligibility, and 4) and an imperfectly monitored job search requirement. The model is parameterized to fit the size of scope of unemployment insurance in the United States. Removing unemployment insurance from the model leads to only a 0.1% consumption equivalent increase in average welfare. Simplifying assumptions about the structure of unemployment insurance, such as allowing all job losers to receive benefits, lead to much larger welfare effects similar to the effects found in the past literature. Understanding the welfare effects of unemployment insurance requires careful modeling of the structure of the program."

Campaign contributions by politically supportive underwriters can be associated with lower issuance costs. Alternatively, contributions can influence a politician to accept greater costs. This paper's evidence suggests that contributions influence politicians: In the absence of an underwriter auction, underpricing increases with the chosen underwriter's contributions relative to others. Moreover, the difference in the fees charged by contributing underwriters and those charged by non-contributing underwriters is 2.9%. In the presence of an underwriter auction, these results are statistically insignificant."

The near-ZIRP has a significant expansionary effect, and the regime-switching model generates a more realistic predicted path of macro variables than the perfect foresight model. Furthermore, the government purchases multiplier in the near-ZIRP regime is smaller than what the literature finds at the zero lower bound (ZLB), and the contractionary effects of higher productivity found by the recent literature at the ZLB are not present in the regime-switching model."

Overturning the result requires policy-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of crises more than 5-40 standard errors larger than representative estimates. Higher probabilities, larger magnitudes, or longer durations of crises--typical consequences of ineffective macroprudential policy--increase the margin of costs over benefits."

1115,"AB: We study public debt in competitive equilibria in which a government chooses transfers and taxes optimally and in addition decides how thoroughly to enforce debt contracts. If the government enforces perfectly, asset inequality is determined in an optimum competitive equilibrium but the level of government debt is not. Welfare increases if private debt contracts are not enforced. Borrowing frictions let the government gather monopoly rents that come from issuing public debt without facing competing private borrowers. Regardless of whether the government chooses to enforce private debt contracts, the level of initial government debt does not affect an optimal allocation."

1130,AB: Macroeconomic models typically focus on innovations in the level of fundamentals as driver of business cycles because modeling of volatility can be demanding. This paper suggests a simple methodology that can separate the level from the volatility factors without directly estimating the volatility processes. This is made possible by exploiting features in the second order approximation of equilibrium models and using information in a large panel of data to estimate the factors. Augmenting the factors to a VAR shed light on the effects of the level and volatility shocks and their relative importance.

1147,"AB: We study the deterioration of employment in middle-wage, routine occupations in the United States in the last 35 years. The decline is primarily driven by changes in the propensity to work in routine jobs for individuals from a small set of demographic groups. These same groups account for a substantial fraction of both the increase in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations observed during the same period. We analyze a general neoclassical model of the labor market featuring endogenous participation and occupation choice. In response to an increase in automation technology, the framework embodies a tradeoff between reallocating employment across occupations and reallocation of workers towards non-employment. Quantitatively, we find that this standard model accounts for a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine employment and associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment."

Comparing these to local multipliers estimated with the panel provides evidence that local multiplier estimates may be reliable indicators of fiscal policy's aggregate effects. Furthermore, evidence of small positive spillovers is found. Across several specifications, we estimate income and employment multipliers between zero and 0.5. This result is reconciled with the greater-than-one multipliers found in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) by analyzing the Korean War years' impact on the estimation."

We develop a two-step regression strategy that fully exploits the available high-frequency market reaction data to identify the impact of macroeconomic releases and to quantify the effects at lower frequencies. While macroeconomic surprises explain only one tenth of the daily variation in bond yields, their explanatory power improves substantially at lower frequencies, accounting for one third of quarterly variations. The finding is explained by the persistent effects that macroeconomic surprises exert on bond yields, and a less persistent impact of residual factors, which tend to average out when focusing on longer-horizon changes."

These models also make unusual policy predictions: Useless government spending, technical regress, capital destruction, and forward guidance can raise output. Moreover, these predictions are larger as prices become less sticky and as changes are expected further in the future. I show that these predictions are strongly affected by equilibrium selection. For the same interest-rate path, equilibria that bound initial jumps predict mild inflation, small output variation, negative multipliers, small effects of far-off expectations and a smooth frictionless limit. Fiscal policy considerations suggest the latter equilibria."

In the context of a two-sector model with intermediates and nominal wage rigidities in one sector, contractionary monetary shocks account for only a third of the fall in GDP.

Whereas in the early 1980s most of global investment was funded by household saving, nowadays nearly two-thirds of global investment is funded by corporate saving. This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment, implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the determination of the flow of funds across sectors. Changes, including declines in the real interest rate, the price of investment, and corporate income taxes generate increases in corporate profits and shifts in the supply of sectoral saving that are of similar magnitude to those observed in the data."

By issuing liabilities it also creates financial assets held by other sectors of the economy for insurance or liquidity purpose. When the intermediation sector creates less liabilities or their value falls, agents are less willing to engage in activities that are individually risky but desirable in aggregate (bank liabilities channel). The paper shows how financial crises driven by self-fulfilling expectations about the liquidity of the banking sector are transmitted to the real sector of the economy. Since the government could also create financial assets by borrowing, the paper analyzes how public debt affects the issuance of liabilities by the financial intermediation sector."

1378,"AB: Optimal regulatory restrictions on banks have to solve a delicate balance. Tighter regulations reduce the likelihood of banks' distress. Looser regulations foster the allocation of funds toward productive investments. With multiple banks, optimal regulation becomes even more challenging. Banks form partnerships in the interbank lending market in order to face liquidity needs and to meet investment possibilities. We show that the interbank network can suddenly collapse when regulations are pushed beyond a critical level, with a discontinuous increase in systemic risk as the cross-insurance of banks collapses."

If asset managers use cash holdings as a buffer to meet redemptions, they can mitigate fire sales of the assets. If they hoard cash in response to redemptions, they will amplify fire sales. We present a global game model of investor runs and identify conditions under which asset managers hoard cash. In an empirical investigation of bond mutual funds, we find that cash hoarding is the rule rather than the exception and that less liquid bond funds display stronger cash hoarding."

Using a unique dataset of dealer-bond-level transactions, we link changes in liquidity of individual U.S. corporate bonds to dealers' transaction activity and balance sheet constraints. We show that, prior to the financial crisis, bonds traded by more levered institutions and institutions with investment bank like characteristics were more liquid, but this relationship reverses after the financial crisis. In addition, institutions that face more regulations after the crisis both reduce their overall volume of trade and have less ability to intermediate customer trades."

We show that excessive liquidity injection can overheat the sector with lower friction, crowding liquidity out of the sector with higher friction. The crowding-out manifests in a self-reinforcing spiral because of feedback between liquidity inflows, asset prices, and collateral values. The paper highlights the effect of financial frictions on the allocation and distribution of liquidity in an economy, demonstrating misallocation of liquidity (credit) under excessive liquidity injection."

This simultaneously endogenizes both average match productivity and the division of output between workers and firms. In existing matches, wages partly reflect labor market conditions at the time of hiring. A positive TFP shock therefore reduces the aggregate labor share, making it counter-cyclical. However, greater competition and lower unemployment increase labor's share among new firms. As more firms enter, the aggregate labor share rises and eventually overshoots its initial level, as in the data."

57,"AB: The dynamics of wealth inequality are studied in a continuous-time Blanchard/Yaari model. Investment returns are idiosyncratic and subject to Knightian uncertainty. In response, agents formulate robust portfolio policies. These policies are nonhomothetic, wealthy agents invest a higher fraction of their wealth in uncertain assets yielding higher mean returns. This produces a feedback mechanism that amplifies inequality. It also produces an accelerated rate of convergence, which helps resolve a puzzle recently identified by Gabaix et al. (2016). An empirically plausible increase in uncertainty can account for about half of the recent increase in top wealth shares."

Before the reform, SOE workers enjoyed similar job security as government employees. The reform caused massive SOE layoffs, but government employees kept their ""iron rice bowl."" The changes in the relative unemployment risks for SOE workers provide a clean identification of income uncertainty. With self-selection biases mitigated by focusing on government assigned jobs, precautionary savings account for about 40 percent of SOE households' wealth accumulation. Moreover, demographic groups more vulnerable to the reform also accumulated more precautionary wealth."

Such adverse selection generates multiple steady states and both local and global indeterminacy, and can give rise to equilibria with probabilistic jumps in credit, consumption, investment and employment driven by Markov sunspots under calibrated parameterizations and fully rational expectations. Introducing reputational effects eliminates defaults and results in a unique but still indeterminate steady state. Finally we generalize the model to firms with heterogeneous and stochastic productivity, and show that indeterminacies and sunspots persist."

This note expands their work to study substitutability between new computer equipment and labor in individual occupations as opposed to all occupations combined. Preliminary empirical evidence suggests (1) significantly different elasticities of substitution between computers and labor across occupations and (2) a strong correlation between productivity growth of computers and labor in occupations where these two inputs are complementary. When they are substitutes, however, their productivity growth rates appear uncorrelated. These findings have the potential to amplify or weaken the magnitude of the aggregate productivity slowdown explained by making their approach a promising avenue for future research."

We use a neoclassical growth framework to analyze how business cycle fluctuations interact with a long-run transition towards a skill-intensive technology. In the model, the adoption of new technologies by firms and the acquisition of new skills by workers are concentrated in downturns due to low opportunity costs. As a result, shocks lead to deeper recessions, but they also speed up adoption of the new technology. Our calibrated model matches both the long-run downward trend in routine employment and key features of the Great Recession."

186,"AB: Using newspaper job ad text from 1960 to 2000, we measure job tasks and the adoption of individual information and communication technologies (ICTs). Most new technologies are associated with an increase in nonroutine analytic tasks, and a decrease in nonroutine interactive, routine cognitive, and routine manual tasks. We embed these interactions in a quantitative model of worker sorting across occupations and technology adoption. Through the lens of the model, the arrival of ICTs broadly shifts workers away from routine tasks, which increases the college premium. A notable exception is the Microsoft Office suite, which has the opposite set of effects."

Because they have more economic activity and a longer firm history, large firms have produced more data. As processor speed rises, abundant data attracts more financial analysis. Data analysis improves investors' forecasts and reduces equity uncertainty, reducing the firm's cost of capital. When investors can process more data, large firm investment costs fall by more, enabling large firms to grow larger."

248,"AB: Has the emergence of information technology changed the structure of employment and earnings in the US? We propose a new index of occupation-level IT intensity and document several long-term changes in the occupational landscape over the past decades. Using Census and US KLEMS micro-data, we show that: (i) the bulk of productivity growth after 1950 is concentrated in IT intensive sectors, (ii) the share of workers in IT jobs has expanded significantly, with little or no pause and IT jobs enjoy a large and growing earnings premium, even after controlling for general task requirements (e.g., cognitive, non-routine), and (iii) the rise of the IT intensive employment share is closely associated with declines in the manufacturing employment share. While earnings premia for college-educated and cognitive/non-routine workers have flattened in the aggregate since 2000, we show that they continued growing in IT intensive jobs and that these jobs have played a key role in accounting for the surge of high tech service labor productivity. We also use our IT intensity index to estimate industry-specific elasticities of substitution between IT and non-IT intensive labor, finding values of 1.6 in manufacturing and 1.3 in services. Finally, we revisit a long-standing question about the relationship between technological progress and productivity and provide evidence that occupation-level IT intensity is positively associated with output growth, especially in the services sector."

Two assumptions are key: ""robot"" capital is distinct from traditional capital in its degree of substitutability with human labor and only capitalists and skilled workers save. We analyze a range of variants that reflect widely different views of how automation may transform the labor market. Our main results are surprisingly robust: automation is good for growth and bad for equality, in the benchmark model real wages fall in the short run and eventually rise, but ""eventually"" can easily take generations."

Both channels can increase welfare, but at the optimal SDI they are at odds. Welfare gains from additional risk-sharing are reduced by overly incentivizing workers to choose risky occupations. In a calibration, optimal SDI increases welfare by 6.3% relative to actuarially fair insurance, mostly due to risk sharing."

We document several new facts on product reallocation. First, every quarter around 8 percent of products are reallocated in the economy, and the entry and exit of products are prevalent among different types of firms. Second, most reallocation of products occurs within the boundaries of the firm. The entries and exits of firms only make a small contribution in the overall creation and destruction of products. Third, product reallocation is strongly pro-cyclical and declined by more than 25 percent during the Great Recession. This cyclical pattern is almost entirely explained by a decline in within firm reallocation. Motivated by these facts, we study the causes and consequences of reallocation within incumbent firms. As predicted by Schumpeterian growth theories, the rate of product reallocation strongly depends on the innovation efforts of the firms and has important implications for revenue growth, improvements in products' quality, and productivity dynamics. Our estimates suggest that the decline in product reallocation through these margins has contributed greatly to the slow growth experienced after the Great Recession."

466,"AB: To what extent can monetary policy impact business innovation and productivity growth? We use a New Keynesian model with endogenous total factor productivity (TFP) to quantify the TFP losses due to the constraints on monetary policy imposed by the zero lower bound (ZLB) and the TFP benefits of tightening monetary policy more slowly than currently anticipated. In the model, monetary policy influences firms' incentives to develop and implement innovations. We use evidence on the dynamic effects of R&D and monetary shocks to estimate key parameters and assess model performance. The model suggests significant TFP losses due to the ZLB."

566,"AB: This paper studies the impact of state-level land-use restrictions on U.S. economic activity, focusing on how these restrictions have depressed macroeconomic activity since 2000. We use a variety of state-level data sources, together with a general equilibrium spatial model of the United States to systematically construct a panel dataset of state-level land-use restrictions between 1950 and 2014. We show that these restrictions have generally tightened over time, particularly in California and New York. We use the model to analyze how these restrictions affect economic activity and the allocation of workers and capital across states. Counterfactual experiments show that deregulating existing urban land from 2014 regulation levels back to 1980 levels would have increased US GDP and productivity roughly to their current trend levels. California, New York, and the Mid-Atlantic region expand the most in these counterfactuals, drawing population out of the South and the Rustbelt. General equilibrium effects, particularly the reallocation of capital across states, account for much of these gains."

599,"AB: American politics have been characterized by a high degree of partisan conflict in recent years. Combined with a divided government, this has led not only to significant Congressional gridlock, but also to spells of high fiscal policy uncertainty. The unusually slow recovery from the Great Recession during the same period suggests the possibility that the two phenomena may be related. In this paper, I investigate the hypothesis that political discord depresses private investment. To this end, I construct a novel high-frequency indicator of partisan conflict. The partisan conflict index (PCI) uses a semantic search methodology to measure the frequency of newspaper articles reporting lawmakers' disagreement about policy. I find a negative relationship between the PCI and aggregate investment in the US. Moreover, the decline is persistent, which may help explain the slow recovery observed since the 2007 recession ended. Partisan conflict is also associated with lower capital investment rates at the firm level, even when economic policy uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions are controlled for. I estimate that about 27% of the decline in corporate investment between 2007-2009 can be attributed to a rise in partisan conflict."

616,"AB: Private nonresidential investment contracted sharply during the Great Recession in most advanced economies and remains well below its pre-2008 trend. While weakness in business investment naturally accounts for a short term drop in the aggregate demand for goods and services, a persistent decline in new capital formation is also bound to have long lasting effects on an economy's ability to produce. Some of the reasons behind this large and prolonged contraction in corporate investment are readily apparent. They include both a sharp tightening in credit conditions in the immediate aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crisis, and a secular decline in productivity growth. Although each of these developments was likely important on its own, even their combined effect seems insufficient to generate the observed slump in non residential investment during the last decade Gala et al. (2016). This paper explores an alternative explanation for the observed decline in investment. Specifically, it investigates the role played by rising uncertainty about future economic policy due to increased partisan conflict since around 2010. The ultimate findings are perhaps best viewed as merely suggestive. Nevertheless, by carefully developing novel measures of policy uncertainty, the paper does succeed in laying important foundations for future studies."

Our theoretical analysis shows that model uncertainty can generate distorted negative (positive) capital investment effects during price declines (reversals) in equilibrium when there is information feedback from financial markets. Empirically, we find that forced sales of corporate bonds by financial institutions had a significant negative impact on the capital investment and product market competitiveness--measured by market shares and price-cost margins--of exposed firms during the financial crisis. These adverse real effects on exposed firms were also vertically transmitted to their suppliers and customers."

Inflation interacts with corporate taxation via the deductibility of i) capital expenditures and ii) interest payments on debt. Through the first channel, inflation increases firms' taxable profits and further distorts their investment decisions. Through the second, expected inflation affects the effective real interest rate and stimulates investment. When debt is collateralized, the second effect dominates. Therefore, present a tax-advantage to debt financing, positive long-run inflation enhances welfare by mitigating or even eliminating the investment distortion."

Hence, monetary policy can directly affect the liquidity and balance sheet strength of firms through existing loans. We show that firms--especially financially constrained firms--with more unhedged loans display a stronger sensitivity of their stock price, cash holdings, inventory, and fixed capital investment to monetary policy. This effect disappears when policy rates are at the zero lower bound, revealing a new limitation of unconventional monetary policy. The floating-rate channel is at least as important as the bank lending channel operating through new loans."

It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months."

732,"AB: Systemic risk builds up during booms in an economy featuring asymmetric information in asset markets, where investors' hidden effort choices endogenously determine asset quality distribution. Higher asset prices during booms induce more investors to sell their assets, which lowers their incentive to improve quality. This quality deterioration in turn makes the economy vulnerable to future exogenous shocks because market breakdowns become more likely. Private agents do not internalize that their effort choices worsen future adverse selection problems, and thus the planner may improve welfare by taxing trade and thereby lowering asset prices."

764,"AB: Despite much empirical evidence on business cycle-dependent government spending multipliers, the theoretical channels underlying such results are uncertain. In an environment with involuntary unemployment, this paper shows that downward nominal wage rigidity, which arises only in recessions, can generate business cycle-dependent government spending multipliers. In line with Keynesian views, a demand stimulus reduces unemployment in recessions and may not drive up inflation and wages as in expansions. Thus, the positive income effects from reduced unemployment and weaker crowding-out effects from a smaller increase in the real interest rate enhance the expansionary spending effects in recessions. The theoretical implications are largely consistent with existing empirical evidence on business cycle-dependent government spending effects on key macroeconomic variables."

A structural estimation of the model is conducted based on Texas city-level data that covers three years--1990, 2000 and 2010. Simulations help clarify how much the thick-market effect amplifies the impact of unemployment. A three-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate lowers the price by 10.74% and reduces the transaction volume by 5.49%. Incorporating a feedback mechanism from housing prices to unemployment strengthens the amplification magnitude of the thick-market effect."

798,"AB: In a general equilibrium macroeconomic model with a banking system that can hold large excess reserves and is subject to (possibly binding) capital constraints, I study how the quantity of government-provided monetary assets is related to the price level in steady state. When the central bank does not pay interest on reserves, the price level moves one-for-one with the monetary base. If, instead, the central bank can pay interest on reserves at market rates, the price level can decouple from the quantity of monetary assets in the economy: a larger monetary base need not imply a higher price level. However, for large enough levels of reserves, the capital constraint binds and the tight link between money and prices reemerges."

814,"AB: Trust in policy makers fluctuates significantly over the cycle, evaporating during crises and affecting the transmission mechanism. Despite this, it is absent from the literature. We build a monetary model where trust emerges endogenously as an equilibrium of a strategic interaction (moral hazard with uncertainty on policy actions) between betrayal-averse agents and policy makers with stochastic incentives to deviate, conditioned on past policy outcomes as signals. A fall in trust, due to shocks or policy actions, increases the price that agents attach to future contingencies, amplifies fluctuations, and steepens the sacrifice ratio. We test the transmission of shocks through VAR analyses where trust is proxied by answers to the Eurobarometer surveys."

Bank stock prices decline significantly following unanticipated increases in the level or slope of the yield curve. The reaction is larger for banks that rely heavily on core deposits but is reduced for banks with a large maturity mismatch, consistent with banks' role in maturity transformation. Policy-induced interest rate changes appear to affect accounting profits primarily through net interest margins and changes in the composition of bank balance sheets."

850,"AB: This paper analyzes sovereign bondholdings by 20,000 banks in 191 countries and 20 sovereign default episodes over 1998-2012, establishing two robust facts. First, banks hold many government bonds (on average 9% of assets) in normal times, particularly banks making fewer loans and operating in less financially-developed countries. Second, during default years, banks with the average exposure to government bonds exhibit a lower growth rate of loans than banks without bonds (7-percentage points lower). These results indicate that the ""dangerous embrace"" between banks and their government plays a key role during sovereign defaults and its strength depends on local conditions."

867,"AB: In an open market operation, the central bank swaps currency for bonds. We show how injecting money in this way is different from transfers, the way policy is usually formulated. The model captures liquidity explicitly by modeling the roles of assets in frictional exchange. Under various specifications for market structure and the acceptability or pledgeability of assets, we discuss implications for the Fisher and quantity equations, the possibility of negative nominal yields, liquidity traps, and market segmentation. When liquidity is endogenized using information theory, multiple equilibria emerge, with different policy predictions. Interest on reserves and quantitative easing are discussed."
